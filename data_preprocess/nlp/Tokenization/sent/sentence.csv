0-        Entry originally posted on 8 August 2003 .
1-This is not a journal in the traditional sense of the word.
2-This is an exploration, a new beginning mapped out through language and metaphor.
3-There are a great many changes that are taking place in my life.
4-Tommorrow, I will become a mother to a tuxedo cat named Demeter.
5-In two weeks, I will be starting graduate school, embarking on a life-long journey into the world of academia.
6-My friend, Julius has joined the Navy and will be shipped off to basic training next week.
7-Lots of changes.
8-So, this space is a reflection of those changes, the need to write and think beyond the traditional weblog, livejournal, or daily journal.
9-This space will be composed of ideas, broad themes, academic pursuits, and the occasional antedote about graduate school and life, in general.
10-There will not be an archive section, because the purpose of this space is to write and live in the present and not rehash the past nor to dwell on the future.
11-Right now, I am walking in darkness.
12-"For the love of God is broader that the measure of the mind And the heart of the Eternal is most wonderfully kind."
13--Our Lady of Mount Carmel Hymn  Michael was the first openly gay man that I met in life.
14-Every day after World Literature we would walk to the college cafeteria and eat lunch together, sometimes studying for a test, but mostly we discussed his sexuality and his faith.
15-I was curious about him, about how he could be both gay and Christian.
16-I grew up in a Southern Baptist tradition that labeled homosexuals as deviants who were out to corrupt Godde-fearing people.
17-Listening and learning about life through the eyes of scared adults, anything and everything can be painted as black or white, right or wrong, and good or evil.
18-When you are a child, it is hard to see the that the world is comprised of multiple shades of grey.
19-Therefore, it is easy, too easy, to judge others for their differences, because you are not yet comfortable in your own skin.
20-At a time when I was advocating at the top of my lungs against institutionalized Christianity, Michael was advocating in favor of the church.
21-It baffled me that he did not consider it a paradox, a contradiction, or an oxy-moron to be a gay man and a Christian.
22-I did not understand how he could support and participate in an institution that stated that Godde hated him for who he loved.
23-Michael told me that he believed that Godde is merciful, kind, and loving, rather than a vindictive deity that is pissed at the world.
24-"Sometimes the people in charge of the religion," he said, "get so wrapped up in the rules that they forget about the message.
25-The message of Godde, of Christ, is ultimately about love for your fellow man."
26-A few weeks later, Michael broke down another barrier of prejuidice that resided inside me.
27-He told me that he was HIV positive.
28-I remember that we had been sharing a basket of french fries and I was paralyzed with fear at the thought of contracting the disease.
29-Now, I realize that it was a naive and foolish fear, but at that time it was a life-altering experience, because it showed me that who you sleep with is insignificant in the grand scheme of life.
30-I never saw Michael after that semester.
31-I tried to track him down several times, but never succeeded and I have moments when I wonder if he is even still walking among us.
32-I am convinced that he was an angel, a messenger sent to me by Godde to teach me about compassion, honesty, and love.
33-In light of recent events that have taken place within my community of faith, I have thought about my friendship with Michael more and more and I often wonder what he would think of all this controversy surrounding a gay man that wants to bring people closer to Godde.
34-To me it is clear that Godde places people in our lives to teach, inspire, and make us better human beings.
35-Godde does not discriminate and I am very proud of the Episcopal church for recognizing that truth by ordaining Gene Robinson.
36-I will stand by my church and my faith, regardless of the political ramifications that come from this decision.
37-It is my firm belief that, eventually, we will all have to answer for our actions.
38-To the individuals that are quick to suggest that Gene Robinson will be punished by Godde for his relationship with a man, may I remind you all that casting judgement is also considered to be a sin.
39-Instead of pointing fingers, learn from this man.
40-Open your hearts and embrace the message that is being sent to you.
41-A couple of years ago, I wrote a short story entitled, "Faith is a Funny Thing."
42-I wrote this story at a time in my life when my quest for spiritual direction was beginning to resemble a fruitless search for a needle in a haystack.
43-In the story, a young woman find solace in a dusty cathedral, the very institution that she spent years denouncing.
44-It was a piece that would foreshadow my return to the church in the years to come.
45-I was a spiritual pilgrim for the span of a decade, researching and practicing a variety of religions.
46-I attended a service at a Jewish synagogue, read Thich Nhat Hanh's  Living Buddha, Living Christ , held a full moon ritual in my living room, and attended Catholic Mass on a Sunday afternoon.
47-In Yann Martel's  The Life of Pi , the main character, Pi, practices a multiplicity of religions and sees no conflict in his syncretism.
48-Halfway through the book, Pi and his family are walking through town and are approached by the leaders of the local temple, church, and mosque.
49-Each leader tells Pi that he must chose a religion to practice.
50-He can be a devout Hindu, Christian, or Muslim, but he can not practice all three faiths at the same time.
51-Pi remarks that all he wants to do is love God.
52-The church leaders are speechless at the simplicity of that statement.
53-I love to tell people the story of my return to the church.
54-I tell them that I am a Christian because of a conversation that I had with a Pagan.
55-My good friend, Loria, listened to me rant on and on about my spiritual crisis until finally she told me that there was no shame in being Christian.
56-She reminded me that there are a lot of interpretations of what it means to be a Christian, that Jesus was a profound teacher and prophet, and that a great deal of beauty remains in the Christian tradition.
57-You just have to find a community that you feel comfortable attending.
58-I did.
59-I am an Episcopalian.
60-I am an open-minded, syncretic, goddess-loving, liberal, Celtic Christian-Buddhist.
61-I believe that Jesus was sent to the Earth to teach and inspire humankind.
62-I believe that Godde is both masculine and feminine and that He/She resides in every single heart that beats on this planet.
63-I am addicted to Sufi poetry, Buddhist philosophy, and Celtic rituals.
64-Religion, faith, is not about the rules, but what road the heart travels.
65-If our motive in life is to love Godde, regardless of the form that being/spirit takes, then does it really matter how we go about expressing that love?
66-My answer is no, it does not matter.
67-Rituals, words, and theology are wonderful things until they begin to place limitations on a person's soul.
68-In the end, what matters the most is how that person uses their faith in the world.
69-Their actions towards other human beings are a reflection of their interpretation of Godde.
70-The rest is just ashes and dust.
71-I believe in eating.
72-I think women especially have this fear of eating, and I think there is a whole euphoric plane you can rise to when you have a good meal.
73-You sit down and with every bite you honestly just say thank you.
74-(Tori Amos)  I was eight years old when I went on my first diet.
75-I have this memory of standing on the scales in the pediatrician's office and hearing the doctor tell my mother that I was fat.
76-As an adult, I look at pictures taken of me during that time and I often wonder what the doctor was thinking.
77-I looked like a healthy, active eight year old girl.
78-My mother immediately put me on a diet.
79-She gave my grandmother the strictest orders not to let me eat anything other than cantaloupe for a snack.
80-Nan took pity on me after the second week of scarfing down cantaloupe; she gave me cookies and ate the fruit herself.
81-I have not eaten cantaloupe since that summer.
82-My weight haunts me.
83-It speaks to me, nit-picks me in the guise of voices from the past; Lance Crane telling our fifth grade classmates that there would be no more ice cream left once I went through the serving line, the constant pressure of being stick thin in high school, and my best guy friend from college telling me that men did not like girls with guts and if I wanted a boyfriend then I would have to lose weight, because no guy would want me otherwise.
84-These are the things that I think about when I am in the presence of a man, even if that man is my lover.
85-I know that it does not do well to dwell on the past, but when you spend your life hearing that you are less because you are more, it is hard to believe that beauty resides within your body.
86-I do not blame my mother for her obsession with my weight.
87-It seems that she too was contantly struggling with her self-esteem in that realm.
88-In her mind big was a simple translation for ugly and so I can not hold her actions against her, because she was suffering from the same societal ideals of beauty.
89-She was struggling to feel beautiful and she wanted me to not have that struggle.
90-It amazes me how many beautiful women, who I am surrounded by on a daily basis, think that they are hiddeous.
91-I read my livejournal, talk to my co-workers, listen to my friends; all of them think that they are less than wonderful, because this world, this culture tells them that they are worthless unless they have Sarah Jessica Parker's body, a body that has no curves, very little cleavage, and is nothing but skin drawn taunt over bone.
92-How is that beautiful?
93-I stand in front of the mirror naked and I like what I see.
94-I walk around my apartment without clothes, because I am, finally, learning to be comfortable in my own skin.
95-It has nothing to do with being sexy, although if you ask me I will tell you that I am sexy, and everything to do with feeling at ease with the woman that I have become.
96-Yes, I want to lose a few more pounds, for health reasons.
97-Next week, I am going back to the pool and swimming laps, because I miss the feel of the water between my thighs and the burning in my lungs when I am holding my breathe.
98-I want to, once again, be addicted to the feel of gliding through the water.
99-I used to swim two miles non-stop, the equivalent of 72 laps in an Olympic-size pool, and I want that to happen again.
100-Until then, I will continue to stand in front of the mirror and celebrate my hips that could bring children into this world with great ease, my breasts that are full and lovely and tinted at the tips with a shade of pink, and my back, which is smooth and, in my opinion, flawless.
101-I am a work of art, because Godde made me.
102-As women, we must learn to embrace ourselves and not fall victim to the societal contructs of beauty.
103-If society had its way, I would be the size of my letter-opener, quiet, docile, and submissive.
104-No.
105-Fucking.
106-Thank You.
107-This one is for you, Dad.
108-I want to talk about censorship.
109-I want to talk about what happens when you get home after a hard day and find that you father has left a message on your machine, telling you that he read your website and that he thinks that using the "f-word" to make a point is very inappropriate.
110-If it were any other person, I would launch into a lecture about my right to free speech, free assembly, and the academic concept of language reclamation.
111-However, when it is with my father, confrontation seems more difficult, because I was daddy's little girl long before I was a feminist.
112-When you plant your feet, heart, mind, and soul under the banner of feminism, loving men reaches a level of frustration that is unparallel to any other experience.
113-There are a great number of men who continue to identify feminism as an anti-male campaign.
114-This is a lie.
115-The complexity with feminism and my relationship with my father is that it is difficult to play out simultaneous roles.
116-I can no longer play the role of dutiful daughter, because the woman inside me is demanding justice.
117-I can no longer pretend that my father is a paragon of perfection, because humans are flawed.
118-For any woman who once thought that her father walked on water, it is a hard lesson to learn when you discover that you are a disappointment to the man who gave you life.
119-I am sorry that I disappointed you, Dad.
120-I am sorry that you think there is hypocrisy in my lifestyle because I use vulgar language and then call myself a Christian, but I will not censor myself for anyone, especially not for you.
121-You were the person who taught me to be strong, to never settle, to always be true to myself, and to believe that I could do anything that I put my mind to.
122-Now, you are telling me that the way that I conduct myself is inappropriate and even though you do not verbalize it, the insinuation in your message is this;  the man who I adore most in the world is ashamed of me.
123-That is a bitter pill to swallow, even for the most ardent feminist.
124-I still remember what it felt like to be the pride and joy in your life and thought it sounds selfish -even to my own ears- it hurts to even consider the possibility that those feelings are no longer present in your heart when you think of me.
125-Sunday evening, I went to church for the first time since my confirmation in June.
126-It is pathetic and sad, how distracted I became this past summer.
127-Lust overcame my heart and I pulled away from Godde, deserting my faith for the simple pleasures of the skin.
128-Yet, when the inevitable happened and that man disappeared from my life, I found myself clinging to my faith like a life-raft.
129-Godde became my glue and she held me together during that horrible time, when I felt him slip through my fingers.
130-Godde continues to hold me together as I am writing these words.
131-It felt like coming home when I received communion.
132-I could feel this overwhelming sense of purpose and direction flood through my body, melting into my soul.
133-When I tasted the bread, for the first time in months, it had a dry bitter flavor, but it connected me with the others in the church.
134-When I drank the wine, I could feel the blood of Christ renewing me, strenghtening me, preparing me for the road ahead.
135-Catholics believe that the Eucharist involves the process of transubstantiation, where the bread and wine are, literally, the body and blood of Christ.
136-Episcopalians recognize this belief, but tend to view the Eucharist as a symbolic act, rather than a literal one.
137-In my opinion, Christianity is about the blessing of this sacrament.
138-Long before there were numerous denominations, the early Christians were meeting in secret to receive bread and wine.
139-They risked persecution, even became martyrs, for this simple act.
140-The Eucharist is an invisible rope that, through this acknowledgement of the sacrifice of Christ, binds Christians to one another.
141-Growing up in a Southern Baptist tradition, I received communion during two services a year, Christmas and Easter.
142-I never considered communion to be an active part of the faith and when I started attending services at the Episcopal church, I thought it strange that Episcopalians received the Eucharist every single Sunday without fail.
143-Now, I can no longer imagine going to church and not receiving communion before I go out into the world.
144-It is the ultimate business card,  please, take our Savior with you.
145-His body and blood are yours, if you wish to carry it inside of you .
146-It is an incredible gift.
147-This is the reason that I am a Christian.
148-The Eucharist brought me comfort when my relationship with Gene was falling apart.
149-I know that there are a number of theological interpretations within the world-wide Christian community, so many that at times it seems as if that community will fall apart.
150-The Eucharist is what binds us together in the face of adversity and change.
151-It is an integral part of the faith.
152-It is what brings Christians back into the church, even after they have been gone for days, weeks, months, and even years.
153-It is a blessing.
154-It is home.
155-Fortune cookies are beautiful things.
156-I get excited, like a school-girl in a candy shop, at the very thought of what the Fates are contemplating sending in my direction.
157-I hold on to my fortunes, those little paper notes that following in the wake of a simple cracking of a cookie.
158-I have it taped to my computer monitor, this one fortune that reminds me to savor life and live for the moment.
159-You will discover the truth in time .
160-I meditate on these words every single day, searching for a better understanding of what they mean in relation to my life.
161-At first, I thought the note was a message from Godde about my ex-boyfriend, putting me at ease about our troubled relationship, letting me know that we would overcome our differences and move forward together.
162-How naive was I, to think that I knew the meaning of truth, the meaning of time?
163-There are moments in my life, where I feel like I am in a rush to learn everything at once.
164-I worry that I will run out of time and that I will never discover the truth about myself, this world, and Godde.
165-I obsess over the fear that I will never find a safe, comfortable, loving relationship with a man.
166-There are so many items that occupy my mind, that drive me to distraction.
167-It is only my faith, my love for Godde, that allows me to take a deep breath and force these thoughts out of my mind.
168-I remind myself that there is a plan, a purpose.
169-Despite the presence of my fears, I feel more grounded now than I have at any other point in my life.
170-I have a wonderful job and my career goals for the future have come full circle in the wake of my return to school.
171-I am surrounded by the most incredible support network of family and friends.
172-I go to an incredible church, a place where I am encouraged to think about my faith instead of blindly accepting doctrine.
173-I have a cat who adores me.
174-Truly, I am a blessed woman.
175-I came here, once or twice since I last wrote, with no topic in my mind.
176-I came here with a voice, but no words to give that voice a contextual meaning.
177-What should I write about in this space?
178-Should I tell you about my ex-boyfriend, how his memory continues to break me, even after he abdicated from my love?
179-Should I discuss the weather, the change of colors and climate?
180-Perhaps, I could write about my indecisiveness regarding the future; professional and personal?
181-With each passing day, I am becoming more of an introvert, more shy with the world.
182-I enjoy my new-found solitude, but I would be lying if I did not admit that there are times when the loneliness hits me hard.
183-There are times when I wish for a companion, preferably of the male variety.
184-I want a man in my life, not for sex or romantic love, but for friendship, for those times when I need strong arms to hold me.
185-I am fully aware of my faults.
186-I am stubborn, tempermental, loud, obsessive compulsive, and a hopeless romantic.
187-I am passionate, almost to the point of being militant, about certain issues.
188-I have no problem with expressing my opinion, to an individual or a crowd of people.
189-I am an emotional eater.
190-I have a vulgar sense of humor and a tendency to use excessive amounts of profanity in any given situation.
191-I am picky about spelling, punctuation, and style.
192-For all of my faults, I have just as many good qualities.
193-I am intelligent.
194-I write a mean research paper.
195-I try to see beauty in everything.
196-I have strong faith.
197-I like to give back to my community.
198-I want to make the world a better place to live, especially for women and children.
199-I want to be a role model for young girls who are searching for an idenity in this crazy messed-up world.
200-I am compassionate and giving.
201-I put my all into my friendships and relationships.
202-I love sex.
203-(Of course there are some individuals who would argue that this is a negative quality.
204-Screw them.)
205-I am honest.
206-Also, while I may never win the Miss America pagent and I know that I have some weight to lose, I do not believe that I am hard on the eyes.
207-I can look myself in the mirror and see a valuable woman who posesses beauty, even if it is of the inward variety.
208-I am not perfect, but I have worth.
209-October is a difficult month for me.
210-Three years ago, Nan died on Friday the thirteenth.
211-She died in her sleep; she had sat down to take a nap during the middle of the day and when her daughter came home from work, she discovered that her mother was no longer among the living.
212-The funeral took place on what would have been an otherwise gorgeous autumn afternoon.
213-As I watched her casket being lowered into the ground, I could not help but ponder the irony of burying my grandmother, my spiritual rock, on such a day as that one.
214-A couple of years later, my family buried our beloved pet, Freckles, after he lost a brief, yet painful, battle with liver disease, an ailment that is very common amongst male cocker spaniels.
215-It happened so fast and I will never forget my mother calling me and tearfully telling me about his passing.
216-She loved that dog.
217-It seems that there is so much pain in life.
218-Sometimes, I want to wail against Godde, because I know that she has the power to cease the world's suffering and sadness.
219-Then, there are moments that I know I am growing stronger, because of the suffering that I have had to endure at times.
220-The fall is the perfect time of year to reflect on that strength.
221-In the tradition of the Celts, the autumn season has become my personal New Year's celebration.
222-I use this time to re-focus my goals, especially since I have a habit of getting distracted over the summer.
223-This is the time of year that I pay homage to those individuals who have passed through the veil.
224-I miss her.
225-There are still days where I feel an overwhelming need to hear her voice over the phone or to hold her hand.
226-When I realize that this is no longer a possibility, there is a sharp pain that runs straight through my heart.
227-It takes my breath away and I start to leak silent tears.
228-I watch the students in this college town.
229-You would think they're carefree, I have seen their trials, Frowning into Shakespeare and practicing their smiles, With every new idea, wondering if they've changed at all, Then they turn away, it happens every day.
230-- Dar Williams,  The Green World    I want to talk about responsibility.
231-Oftentimes, I feel that pressure of responsibility, the higher moral obligation to make the world a better place for us to live.
232-There are those individuals who mock my idealistic desires, but for me, being an optimist is the only way to survive in this crazy place.
233-My faith in Godde prevents me from becoming the World's Greatest Cynic.
234-I am a natural optimist, always wanting to see the good in people and their motivations, and I feel absolutely no shame about that fact.
235-Mother Teresa stated that, "In this life we cannot do great things.
236-We can only do small things with great love."
237-Indeed, it is the small things that make the most difference.
238-The environment is a good example of this point and I have made it a part of said higher obligation to protect the space in which I live.
239-I drive a car that gets good gas-mileage and has the lowest emissions rating in the country.
240-I car-pool to places when it is possible.
241-I recycle paper, plastic, aluminium, and glass products.
242-I take my own shopping bags, made out of thick cloth, to the grocery store and if I am forced to use the plastic bags, I keep and re-use them to carry my lunch to work during the week.
243-Perhaps it is naive of me to be so sure that my actions, alone, can change the world.
244-Certainly, other people think in such terms.
245-On more than one occasion, I have been labeled as a  bleeding heart , a  touchy-feely liberal , and a  hippie tree hugger .
246-I have grown immune to such attempts at attacking my desire, my need, to keep this place clean.
247-I refuse to believe that it is a bad thing to want to leave something beautiful for those who, years after I am gone, will walk this land.
248-Godde did not give us this land to plunder with shameless abandon.
249-When you rape the land, you are, for all intents and purposes, raping Godde, because  She is the land .
250-This type of language, this violent metaphor, is harsh, but true.
251-I am a firm believer in honesty, a trait which far too many individuals have lost sight of and no longer value.
252-We are tied to this place.
253-We are tied to Her.
254-If we, as a society, destroy our planet, then we will be destroying the gift that Godde gave to us.
255-We will be destroying our own lives, the lives of our children, and Godde Herself.
256-I was never one of those girls.
257-I never planned my wedding, most of my Barbie dolls eloped rather than having a frou-frou ceremony.
258-I did not keep a scrapbook full of pictures of rings, dresses, and cakes.
259-In college, when I first discovered feminism, I proclaimed at the top of my lungs that marriage was a patriarchal institution and there was no way that I was going to willingly participate in the ultimate downfall of women.
260-Yet, the entire time that I went through that militant phase I had a dirty little secret.
261-I wanted to be married.
262-I wanted to fall in love with a man.
263-Now, I am older and a bit wiser.
264-I recognize that I can be both, a feminist and a wife.
265-In the last few weeks, I have been contemplating this topic, mostly because I have a great number of friends who either are married or are engaged to be married.
266-I find myself turning into one of those women; clipping dresses and rings out of magazines, thinking about ceremonies, but most of all looking for the ever elusive  Mr.
267-Right .
268-My feminist self knows that such a creature does not exist.
269-I am too cynical to believe, truly, in faerytales.
270-I am no longer viewing the world through child-like eyes.
271-However, the hopeless romantic in me will not stop looking for this individual.
272-I would be lying if I said that I was not ready for love.
273-I would love to be in a relationship with a man, a committed union with someone who wanted to spend his life with me.
274-The problem is that I am not ready to give up all of the things that I would, most likely, need to sacrifice in order to be with this person; traveling abroad, working in Washington D.C., getting my doctorate.
275-I am not sure if I am ready to be that unselfish with my time and energy.
276-What is problematic about this situation is that I give my heart away with too much ease.
277-I am a hopeless romantic and caring for other people is second nature to me, not because I am a woman, but because I am me.
278-It is a seamless part of my identity that I can not divorce from other parts of my life.
279-I crave a partner, a companion, like most of the world.
280-I want to fall in love with a man who would be willing to move to another city/state/country for my career.
281-I want to be involved with a man who is my best friend and loves me because of my flaws and not in spite of them.
282-The hard part about contemplating issues, such as this one, over which I have no control is that I am afraid of the hard, realistic possibility that I may never find this individual.
283-However, I have faith that things will follow the path that they are meant to travel.
284-In the meantime, I am going to take a deep breath and focus on taking life one day at a time.
285-There are days when I feel as new to the experience of living as a newborn child.
286-Those moments often seem so simple that I am certain that I am missing a bigger lesson.
287-Like a speeding car, it passes me by and leaves me standing, searching, on some lonely dirt road called life.
288-Introspection, as wonderful as it is, can be a dangerous thing.
289-Thinking too much and too hard about a particular topic will wear you down, emotionally and mentally, and leave you more confused than when you began your ponderings.
290-I think that Pooh had it right all along; life, and all the tiny moments that comprise it, just  is , not this insatiable push for progress that the human race seems hell bent on completing.
291-Right now, I am studying for a final exam, writing a paper, and trying not to pull out every single strand of my hair.
292-Right now, I am learning to sit back, relax, and breathe.
293-The world may not revolve around me, but it will wait on me for a little while.
294-I think that men, when they are first introduced to me, forget that I am a woman.
295-It is easy for them to see me as the embodiment of a label, a definition.
296-They think that they know everything there is to know about my life, because I call myself a feminist.
297-Assumptions get made at the drop of a hat; I am most definately a man-hater, I am probably a lesbian, and it is incredibly suspect that I have a good, healthy relationship with my father.
298-If I were to place an open advertisement for a life-partner, it would read  single, open-minded, slightly-dorky, academic-type woman seeks single, open-minded, funny man for a life-long commitment, which will include evenings of intellectual ramblings on feminist theory, very bad cooking, obsessive devotion to the art of shagging, cat hair that covers every conceivable surface, eventual birth of children, a house by the sea, and a woman who will stand by your side, no matter what life throws at you.
299-I am too honest for my own good.
300-Most women hide those dark parts, waiting for the moment to reveal thier true nature.
301-I do not live my life in such a manipulative fashion, chosing instead to be completely honest and open about who I am as a woman, for better and for worse.
302-I do not believe in the artificial and it is that dislike for artifice that creates my disdain for dating.
303-In my mind, in my experience, dating is fake.
304-I do not want a romantic illusion, I want a real person in my life, to share my life.
305-I want someone who forgets to leave the toilet seat down and can laugh at his own mistakes and weaknesses.
306-I want a man who thinks that I am beautiful without make-up and who understands that kissing is not a prelude to sex, but a pleasure that is to be explored and enjoyed on its own merit.
307-I want someone who will not run out the door, but will chose to stay by my side the morning after we have made love.
308-I want passion, truth, and someone who is not afraid to love me.
309-Most of all, I want a man who understands that I am a strong-willed, take-charge, opinionated, refuse-to-be-a-doormate type of person; however, at the end of the day, I want to come home and have someone take care of me.
310-In a word, I want  acceptance .
311-I believe in things that I cannot see with my eyes.
312-I hold stock, importance and prominence, in the rest of the senses; touch, taste, hear, and smell.
313-Yesterday, I celebrated the birth of a miraculous man.
314-I cannot prove that he was the son of Godde, but I feel that particular truth down in the depths of my bones.
315-However, he is not the only truth in which I believe nor does my belief in him negate or make impossible the existence of other esteemable tenants.
316-I consider myself a Celtic-Christo-Episco-Pagan, who follows the teachings of Jesus and pays homage to the Goddess.
317-I believe in the existence of faeries, Santa Claus, elves, unicorns; all forms of magic that can only be found by paying attention, by listening to that child-like voice that lives inside of me, a voice that has the potential to disappear if we, human beings, do not guard it with care and love.
318-I hold the words of Buddha close to my heart and I have a penchant for Islamic spiritual poetry.
319-I follow the religious path of the ancient Celtic Church.
320-I use my rosary for prayer and meditation.
321-I believe that evil exists, but I also believe in the overwhelming nature of Good, of Godde.
322-Godde speaks to every man and woman, through every race, religion, and creed.
323-Godde is not reserved for one nation or one brand of theology, but embraces and can be embraced by all who walk this planet.
324-Beauty, happiness and fulfillment, can be found in every tradition.
325-Regardless of your path, I wish you a Blessed Christmas and a Happy New Year.
326-There are some occasions for which Hallmark has no appropriate card to give to another human being.
327-There is no card that expresses a proper sentiment for the friend who has been laid off from work for the second time in three years, for the woman who choses to have an abortion and struggles with that decision for the rest of her life, or for the man who is diagnosed with HIV and is forced to reconcile himself with the fact that he is dying.
328-There is no card for my friend, and co-worker, Nancy who was diagnosed with cancer and has spent the last three years battling this disease.
329-Last week, I discovered that her doctor found four tumors in Nancy's brain and that her chances of living to see another year are very slim.
330-I am struggling with the injustice of this revelation.
331-It is times like these that cause me to question Godde's purpose for people.
332-Is this kind of action the definition of mercy?
333-Is it right for a woman, an individual who has never been anything but wonderful to her co-workers and friends, to suffer in such a manner?
334-How does a person live out the remainder of their life, knowing that with each rotation of the sun they are one day closer to leaving behind all that they have ever known?
335-Sometimes, there are simply no words for the moment, no words to describe the shock you feel at learning that a person in your life will no longer be there to grace you with their smile.
336-There are no words for the sadness, the frustration, and the anger that is felt when good people are forced to suffer and carry an unbearable burden, while the dregs of humanity walk the world and feel no consequences for their actions.
337-This is the hardest part about being a person of faith, not the theology that you adhere to nor the manner in which you daily practice the rituals of your religion, but the need to keep your hand tight around the tenuous thread of hope.
338-The most difficult thing in the world is to have faith when the entire world tries to pull you away from it.
339-I wait for the Red, red - the flow that marks me as a woman.
340-Crimson guilt Of sins once done, Committed In a brazen act Of passion.
341-Once more, I pay the price Of using my body To speak the language of liberation.
342-When did the faerie dust disappear?
343-Did my mother Put Away My favorite doll?
344-I remember a simpler time, Before the Red Sea (with all its glorious might) Swept away my body Leaving my soul in her wake.
345-This is a moment That belongs to Every Woman.
346-A scare, A lunar flow unshed, A potential choice that devastates, And a false line that burns Bright pink.
347-Hope lies in a cardboard box.
348-Feminism is like any other ideology.
349-It shifts, morphs, over time and different people interpret the ideology in a plethora of ways.
350-For me, feminism is mother's milk, a liquid that runs through my veins and becomes one with my life's blood.
351-I am unable to separate my affiliation with feminism from the rest of my life.
352-It is part of my DNA to be a strong woman, but every now and then I forget that I have that strength and fortitude.
353-I neglect that part of myself that can conquer the world, that will be an individual.
354-I am having a revival of my political alignment.
355-In the last few weeks, I have struggled with what it means to be a Christian and a feminist, my weight and self-worth issues, and sexual harrassment in the workplace.
356-Yesterday, I realized that I had been living my life in a vacuum, head buried under sand, letting events and opportunities pass me by without second glance.
357-Ani DiFranco sings that,  us people are just poems / we're 90% metaphor / with a leanness of meaning / approaching hyper-distillation / and once upon a time / we were moonshine .
358-Once upon a time, we were pure, rid of societal impurity.
359-I want to reclaim that fierceness, that independence of mind and self once more.
360-I want to recover my strength from the terror that I experienced on the morning of yesterday.
361-No longer will I be claustrophobic, held back from the world for fear of making mistakes and disappointing other people in my life.
362-I want to eat, sleep, drink, fuck and breathe feminism through my pores.
363-This may no make sense to you, those individuals in cyberspace who know nothing about me but for the words that I write.
364-This may seem a jumble, a hodge-podge of vernacular guaranteed to confuse the mind and cause the heart to twist and turn.
365-It is none of these things and all of these things at once.
366-This is a statement.
367-This is a manifesto.
368-I am a woman who believes, who lives her life under the concept, that feminism can and will free men and women.
369-I am a white, anglophile, heterosexual, woman-loving, socially-liberal, fiscally-responsible, pro-choice, veggie-tree-hugger, rockin' mama, intellectual, believer in fae feminist.
370-No longer will I feel as if I am less of a woman, because I expect more from men; more being equality, respect, love, friendship, lust, and decency.
371-After all, would you expect any less of a poem?
372-Procrastination, to be sure, is an artform.
373-It is one that I have cultivated through many years of school, secondary and post-secondary education.
374-There are days when it seems that I will never be motivated enough to pursue academia and then there are moments where it feels as though I am meant to be nothing but an academic, that scholarship and research will be my life.
375-The hard part about going to graduate school on a part-time basis is finding the time to live.
376-When you are an undergraduate student, your job is school and your life is a separate entity.
377-When you work for a living and go to school at night, school, suddenly, becomes your life.
378-All other aspects of daily living fall by the wayside and you are plunged into a monotonous routine of work and school, work and school, work and school.
379-Procrastination, as a result, becomes more than an artform.
380-It becomes as essential to life and breathing air and drinking water.
381-It becomes sex, something that we do not need to survive, but is something that we cannot imagine living without.
382-Therefore, one could conclude, procrastination is nothing short of fucking with our own self.
383-I am having a hard time making decisions lately.
384-This summer semester has been really difficult for me to get through.
385-For some reason, I am not liking school as much as I thought I would.
386-Truth be told, I hate writing papers and sitting through hours of class lectures.
387-I am not sure if this is a phase, but more and more I am beginning to believe that I am not cut out for academia.
388-I want to teach.
389-I want a classroom.
390-I want a life outside of publishing and research.
391-I am so bloody sick of writing about women, gender, and feminism.
392-To think that I wanted, thought that I wanted, to study this material for the rest of my life.
393-I love being a feminist, but I hate writing about it.
394-I hate the theory behind it.
395-I want to be a practicing feminist, not a stuff academic one.
396-There are times where it seems that I am not meant to be anything but an academic, then I start thinking about all the years of school that I have left in store for me.
397-At best, I will complete school by thirty-three.
398-Not old at all, but do I want to be in school for that long?
399-I am not sure.
400-Right now, I just want to get through this fucking semester.
401-So small and fearless My fickle heart,  My brave path, My one true love.
402-A list of sins Follow inmy wake, Trailing afterme.
403-Give me amnesty, Sophia.
404-Protect my mourning soul And comfort my love-starved self.
405-I cling to you.
406-I pine for your presence, Godde.
407-Waiting anxiously for the taste of your salvation upon my lips.
408-I imagine salvation tastes - like honey.
409-- like green tea and jasmine.
410--like salt licked from a man's post-coital, sweat-soaked back.
411-I imagine salvation tastes Wonderful.
412-Who do I have to fear In this colourful (colour-stained) world?
413-What pagan soul have I unravelled With my Jesus-freak sensibilities?
414-In a woman's arms, Your arms, I wish to lie.
415-You seem like grace incarnate to me.
416-Godde is manifest.
417-Not unreachable.
418-Eager to be traced.
419-The small of a woman's back, (the gateway to the womb) The curve of her neck (the matching pulse point of life) Laying shallow into the valley Of her breasts (the center of her heart).
420-Godde pulses, sweats, and breathes Alive in us all.0-12,May,2004

0-            The history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan.
1-Seitan (say-TAHN) is made from gluten.
2-Gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic.
3-Known as Seitan in Japan, as kofu in China, and as "wheat meat" and "gluten" here in the U.S., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute.
4-It has been eaten in China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the Middle East for thousands of years.
5-Gluten is often referred to in Chinese restaurants as "Buddha food", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian Buddhist monks as a meat substitute.
6-It is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition.
7-As a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of B vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol.
8-A 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat.
9-The same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats.
10-As recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement.
11-Another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this.
12-Most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce).
13-If you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon).
14-Moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes.
15-Many vegetarians' first experience with eating gluten is at Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants, where it's called "mock duck", "mock chicken", etc.
16-When it's sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it's called Seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word "gluten" lacks consumer appeal.
17-It stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too "meaty."
18-However, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, Wheat Meat" is growing in popularity.
19-Seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency.
20-The dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop.
21-Next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran.
22-What is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu.
23-When raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it's called "seitan".
24-It is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat.
25-It can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried.
26-Each version yields a different texture.
27-Oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering.
28-Baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan.
29-Pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture.
30-Fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well.

           Westwood has  lost weight by eating high protein meat substitutes  and has enjoyed such a lift from his better diet and fitness that he is being sponsored by a well-known meat substitute company ( urlLink Quorn ) for two years.
32-After ending three years in the wilderness since his heady 2000 with two wins last year, Westwood, lying 64th in Europe and with only moderate performances on the U.S. Tour, is aiming to prove he really is back.
33-'I saw the benefits Darren was getting and I've felt like I needed to do something for a long time,' said Clarke's management stablemate.
34-'The great thing is, I've lost all this weight and on the (Reuters) statistics I'm (driving) 10-15 yards longer.'
35-urlLink Yves Veggie Cuisine - Products   My favourite deli slices.
36-Yves Veggie Cuisine pepperoni slices are great on a home-made pizza!
37-Also, all street hot dog vendors in Toronto carry smoky-flavoured Yves Good dog that has only 77 calories, 2 grams of fat, 13 grams of soy protein and provides 53% of the daily value of vitamin B12, which makes it one of the best hot dogs around.
38-Hosted by Kim O'Donnel washingtonpost.com Staff Writer Thursday, April 29, 2004; 12:00 PM  Released MAY 5, 2004  A graduate of Peter Kump's New York Cooking School, Kim spends much of her time in front of the stove or with her nose in a cookbook.
39-The transcript follows.

41-________________________________________________   Kim O'Donnel: Hello out there.
42-It's been a while since our last get-together.
43-For those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last Thursday on the month.
44-Since we last discussed, I came across a fun piece on Yahoo!
45-about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: "flexatarian."
46-I think that would aptly describe my eating habits.
47-Interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole.
48-So, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted.
49-Onward...   _______________________   I'm a goin veggie huntin....: Kim!
50-; Two questions: First, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon?
51-Second, what great things should I look for at the farmers market this saturday morning?
52-Kim O'Donnel: The nice people at Arlington Courthouse have been very patient with me as I've not gotten my act together on setting a date.
53-It'll be sometime in May or June, probably June.
54-Funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on WTOP this morning was all about my finds last weekend.
55-Think green, kids.
56-It's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty!
57-_______________________   Frederick, Md.
58-: I'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking.
59-However, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training.
60-Can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly?
61-(My goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.)
62-Kim O'Donnel: There is a vegetarian cooking school in New York City that has a good reputation.
63-Name escapes me at the moment; it might be Natural Cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly.
64-Check out shawguides.com   _______________________   St. Paul, Minn.: My two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk.
65-I don't think he gets enough calcium.
66-Any suggestions?
67-And can you tell me how to make a smoothie?
68-After I make one, how long can I leave it in the refrigerator?
69-Kim O'Donnel: Lentils are loaded with calcium.
70-Spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: I prefer with yogurt, and to it, I add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend.
71-I don't add ice or juice because I like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes.
72-Doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour.
73-_______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim.
74-Just got back from New Orleans and while I made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, I'd love to make my own.
66-Any suggestions?
76-I'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe?
77-Kim O'Donnel: I think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the Gimme Lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra!
78-_______________________   Prince Frederick, Md.
79-: Can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of Sherpas in Tibet.
80-Most of what I've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least.
81-I want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat.
82-I still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things.
83-I can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet.
84-But what really turned me off about meat was reading "Fast Food Nation."
85-It revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us.
86-I recommend everyone read it, as well as "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair.
87-Kim O'Donnel: Prince,  Vegetarian cookbooks have come a LONG way from the days of co-ops and communes...There are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding.
88-Immediately what comes to mind are titles by Deborah Madison, Jeanne Lemlin and then there's Crescent Dragonwagon's "Passionate Vegetarian", loads of titles by Robin Robertson...and all of them are very contemporary.
89-_______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,   My husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts.
90-Any ideas as to what it is?
91-Thanks a bunch!
92-Kim O'Donnel: The green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach.
93-This is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too.
94-You can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, REALLY well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta...   _______________________   Virginia: Does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef?
95-I am looking for big pieces, not something that is "ground."
96-I have tried a couple of things without much luck.
97-Thanks!
98-Kim O'Donnel: Many looking for similar products like the taste of Quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got Quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas?
99-_______________________   Anonymous: I have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk.
100-They sell it at Whole Foods.
101-Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for chiming in...that's what I was thinking...   _______________________   Silver Spring, Md.
102-: For meatless jambalaya, I'd use tempeh, I like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish.
103-Some seitan might be good for texture also.
104-Kim O'Donnel: Ah, bueno.
105-Thanks, Silver!
106-_______________________   Reston, Va.: I'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but I hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref.
107-northern va)?
108-Kim O'Donnel: Yes, yes, yes!
109-Arlington Courthouse, on Saturday mornings.
110-Dupont Circle and Takoma Park, Sunday mornings.
111-_______________________   Veggie burger: I've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it.
112-Can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe?
113-Not lentils, please (ewww...)   Kim O'Donnel: A few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period.
114-Since then, I made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation.
115-I did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but I gotta get you the details.
116-I don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after I look through my papers at home...   _______________________   Arlington, Va.: We like to eat Morning Star Farms "Chik Nuggets" - they also come in patties.
117-My son particularly likes to have this when friends who "hate" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something NOT chicken.
118-Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, Arlington.
119-_______________________   East Falls Church, Va.: Hi, Kim!
120-You mentioned last chat (Tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle.
121-I presume you peel it first, but I, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option.
122-(for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?).
97-Thanks!
124-Kim O'Donnel: Hey EFC,  Yeah, I cut off what I need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m Works really well, and no, you do get what you need.
125-_______________________   Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.: For your reader who inquired about the vegetarian  cooking school .
126-.
126-.
128-yes, it's called the Natural  Gourmet Cookery School  (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in New York City.
129-They also do dinners open to the public on most  Friday evenings.
130-Sounds like a great opportunity to  sample great food from the students.
131-Kim O'Donnel: Hey, thanks for following up!
132-_______________________   New York, N.Y.: Kim,   I need fruit help.
133-I feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right?
134-What should I look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season?
135-I'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when I all really want is to stop at Kripsy Kreme!
136-;   Thanks!
137-;   Kim O'Donnel: It IS a tough time for fruit.
138-I was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week.
139-Soon come: local strawberries, plus figs.
140-Mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi...   _______________________   Re: Low Fat Veggie Cookbook: Moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes MANY more things than what sherpas would eat.
141-It has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations.
142-Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for reminding me...my Moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use.
143-_______________________   For Reston looking for farmers market in NoVa:: The Falls Church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings   Kim O'Donnel: Great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader.
144-_______________________   Alexandria, Va.: Hi Kim!
145-When you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the Alexandria Farmers' Market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area.
146-It's open from 5:30am (ugh!
147-)to 10:30am every Saturday.
148-Kim O'Donnel: Very glad that you've reminded me, Alexandria.
149-_______________________   Virginia: I am so excited, I just have to share.
150-For years, I have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in Indian restaurants, but the ones I made were never as good.
151-I finally found the secret: rosewater.
152-You only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference.
153-Also, the frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe's make lassi-making very easy, and I find the quality to be very good.
154-I have been drinking them every day this week!
155-Kim O'Donnel: Funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some Indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing.
156-_______________________   Silver Spring, Md.
157-: Hi Kim -  I have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc...
158-I've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy.
159-I'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it.
160-Do you have any ideas?
161-Love your chats - you rock!
162-Kim O'Donnel: Squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, Silver.
163-Some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions.
164-Sounds nice.
165-_______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, I want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings?
166-Also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!)
167-curry recipe to use with this?
168-Would I cook the tofu at all before adding it in?
169-I'm not sure where to start...
170-Thanks!!
171-Kim O'Donnel: Do you want to do coconut milk curry?
172-Talk to me.
173-_______________________   Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim,  White bean bruschetta - I tried to make it  last night but forgot the ingredients -  I  bought the wrong kind of beans.
174-Here's  what I came up with so far - what am I  missing (or how can I vary it)?
175-tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil   Kim O'Donnel: The beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in Italy, bruschetta are among the many "salatini" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment.
176-You can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt.
177-Lemon zest is great.
178-Rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry...   _______________________   Fairfax, Va: Kim,   My wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and I'm a happy meat eater.
179-I'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but I'd like to do it on the grill.
180-What can I cook for her that will be flavorful and unique?
181-(And how do I do it)?
97-Thanks!
183-;   Kim O'Donnel: You can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu.
184-Brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne.
185-Serve over rice.
186-You, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim,  Speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on Thursdays in Penn Quarter (I think it was on 7th and E maybe?)
187-Is it coming back?
188-Do you know when?
189-It was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets...
97-Thanks!
191-Kim O'Donnel: Yes, it is.
192-Starting next Thursday, May 6, from 3 to 7.
193-_______________________   Bethesda, Md.
194-: Hello-  Do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here?
195-Preferably in MD.
196-THanks   Kim O'Donnel: Weekend section usually does an annual list which I'm betting will come out next month.
197-Anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots?
198-_______________________   Rockville, Md.
199-: My favorite Italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce.
200-In making this at home would you recommend the "plain old salted" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead...   Kim O'Donnel: Plain, unsalted.
201-You got it...   _______________________   Vegetarian Pigs in a Blanket: Does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket?
202-I am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options.
97-Thanks!
204-;   Kim O'Donnel: I'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hey Kim, A quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend?
205-I'm trying to cut back on sugar, so I'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie.
206-Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes.
207-Can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil...   _______________________   soy bechamel?
208-: Any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce?
209-There's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the March Cooking Light that I'd like to modify.
210-Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work.
211-I don't know for sure.
212-My copy of "Dairy-Free Cooking" offers some "cream sauce" ideas...so why not??
213-_______________________   Vege in Fairfax, Va.: To the question about Paneer from the What's cooking chat.
214-One can drain it in Cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in.
215-Keep in a cold place overnite.
216-Remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in.
217-Actually Mango lassi is not very common in India.
218-Lassi is usually salty.
219-I just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy.
220-Yummy  Try cardamon in your Mango lassi for the extra zing!
221-Kim O'Donnel: Thanks, Fairfax...great tidbits...I'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis...   _______________________   St. Louis, Mo.
222-: Another cookbook suggestion: I started out veggie with the "Horn of the Moon" cookbook by Ginny Callan.
223-Many yummy recipes, all vegetarian.
224-A follow-up book, "Beyond the Moon," includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (Carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.)
225-Worth a look.
226-Kim O'Donnel: Not familiar with this one, St. Lou.
227-Thanks for the tidbit...   _______________________   Suitland, Md.
228-: Does anyone know of a good Soy Cheese brand?
229-Something that actually tastes like cheese?
230-I am looking for a block that I can grate.
170-Thanks!!
232-Kim O'Donnel: Who knows of soy cheese that can be grated???
233-_______________________   Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim!
234-; I have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store.
235-I have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic.
236-I was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first?
97-Thanks!
238-;   Kim O'Donnel: Blanching them does help bring them along, Washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea....   _______________________   Bethesda, Md.
239-: Hello Kim-  I have an eggplant question for you.
240-I generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that I really, really love it.
241-I know it is simple but can't figure it out.
242-I usually have it as antipasto in Italian restaurants or when I was in Italy.
243-It is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar.
244-I don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated.
245-Can you help me?
246-Thanks   Kim O'Donnel: Eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, Bethesda.
247-Was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up?
248-Do tell...   _______________________   Boston, Mass.
249-: Hi Kim,   What can I do with Broccoli besides steam it?
97-Thanks!
251-Kim O'Donnel: I like roasting it, at 500 degrees.
252-But first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that.
253-It's a great treat!
254-_______________________   Indian Head, Md.
255-: Hi Kim!
256-My new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions.
257-I am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch.
258-They are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top!
259-J   Kim O'Donnel: Let's see...I'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!
260-), maybe even some coriander...   _______________________   Washington, D.C.: My special someone has a birthday coming up and I wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them.
261-Do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that I could try and use?
262-Kim O'Donnel: Spectacular and vegetarian...I'm thinking of a curry.
263-I've got an interesting idea for a Thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but I think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest...   _______________________   Oxford, Miss: I'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but I'm getting bored with my recipe.
264-Do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic?
265-Kim O'Donnel: Do you make a sofrito for your r b?
266-You know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...I'd also add a chopped fresh chile...   _______________________   Reston, Va.: Good morning Kim.
267-Still struggling with the white sweet potatos.
268-Any ideas?
97-Thanks!
270-Kim O'Donnel: Not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...I'd roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest...   _______________________   Herndon, Va.: Oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my  marinate recall has lapsed  please advise with some great basics for  marinating - I'm specifically thinking of the  little mushrooms and zucchini I bought  yesterday for BBQ skewers, but a good  marinate could work on most foods...   also, any hints on grilling veg on  skewers?
271-thanks in advance   Kim O'Donnel: Salt really well.
272-Use a brush.
273-Olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size...   _______________________   Reston, VA: Hooray for the mention of the Alexandria farmers'  market.
274-My great-grandfather sold there every  Saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad  tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early  to go to market.
275-There are also lots of stories about  my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that  were packed on Friday...   Kim O'Donnel: Nice story, Reston.
276-Thanks for the memories...   _______________________   Re: strawberry picking: Butler's Orchard, in Germantown (MD).

280-Kim O'Donnel: Ooh...I like that...   _______________________   Dallas, Texas - Arugala: Hi Kim.
281-Wanted to share a great sauce recipe.
282-I sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper.
283-Then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions.
284-Let it all cook together till the sauce thickens.
285-I served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta.
286-At the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe.
287-Very healthy and delicious.
288-And with all the flavors, you won't miss the meat.
289-~Chef in training   Kim O'Donnel: Very nice indeed, Dallas.
290-Keep sending reports of your experiments!
291-_______________________   Washington, DC: This may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans?
292-I.E.
293-does the can say "White Beans" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply?
294-Thanks for the insight.
295-Kim O'Donnel: White beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and Great Northern beans.
296-They are interchangeable.
297-_______________________   Adams Morgan: How does one make a white bean spread?
298-Kim O'Donnel: A can of drained white beans.

306-You're good to go.
307-_______________________   Arlington, VA: Hi,   I hope you can help me.
308-I have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables.
309-Ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables.
310-The only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if I grind up veggies inside dumplings.
311-I tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in Fear Factor eating worms.
312-I think it's a texture thing.
313-Do you have any suggestions?
314-Kim O'Donnel: Take her to the farm market this weekend.
315-Introduce her to a farmer.
316-Let her pick out something that the two of you can make together.
317-Obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes.
318-Let me know how it goes...   _______________________   Kim O'Donnel: Out of time, folks.
319-Thanks for all the good stuff.
320-Take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market!

323-_______________________     2004 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive         
           By JESSICA RAE PATTON, May 7 2004  I recently spent the weekend in Chicago, the city of encased meat.
324-Just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there.
325-At Hot Doug's, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks.
326-But there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend Emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro.
327-Because the fact is, although I'm a vegan, I'm a fool for fake meat.
328-Or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside French fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands.
329-These food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine.
330-But I guess because Chicago's a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as Studs Terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions.
331-I, for one, thank Doug and his colleagues for this.
332-That was one damn good dog.
333-Char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll.
334-I returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that I might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts.
335-I dragged my boyfriend, Art, along to taste-test the real ones.
336-I f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu.
337-At the original Swanky Frank's, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic I-95 on-ramp, the owner, Bob, snorted, "That would be sacrilegious."
338-"But I was in Chicago, and--"  "This isn't Chicago, is it?"
339-He said and walked away.
340-Was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general?
341-Maybe I was nave to the subversive nature of soy protein.
342-And here I just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub.
343-I sat on a rickety stool and ordered French fries and blathered on about writing a food review.
344-The fry cook, who looked like Billy Bob Thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can't write a food review if all you eat is French fries.
345-These guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down.
346-Their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in.
347-In all fairness, our server at the swankier of the Swankies, in Westport, was super-friendly.
348-(Let's consider the first location Skanky Frank's, as to not confuse the two.)
349-She smiled and everything.
350-The place also looked like it had been intimate with both a paintbrush and a sponge in recent memory.
351-Art highly approved of the deep-fried technique.
352-"It makes the texture crackly, not snappy."
353-"Snappy?"
354-"Yeah, some hot dogs are snappy.
355-The skin won't give right away when you bite it, then it snaps."
356-He also liked that the raw onions were self-serve.
357-For the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions.
358-"The bacon's under the dog, where it should be," he noted.
359-The French fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through.
360-We liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box.
361-Dog: $2.90, Fries: $2.25         Rawley's Drive-In 1886 Post Rd., Fairfield, 259-9023  Rawleys' dcor makes Skanky Frank's look positively posh.
362-The wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin.
363-Two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together.
364-"So.
365-Would you ever consider carrying a veggie dog, you think?"
366-"NO WAY!"
367-The one working the grill yelled.
368-"People freak out if we change anything here.
369-We had to repair those walls," he gestured to two white walls behind him, "to meet health codes, and people flipped out.
370-A veggie dog?
371-They'd KILL us!"
372-They got every single thing about our order wrong--handed us someone else's food, gave Art the wrong drink, rang the order up incorrectly, made it "for here" instead of "to go."
373-The more flustered they got, the more they messed up.
374-I didn't mind a bit.
375-It somehow went with the summer camp vibe, and I thought it was probably a fluke.
376-They were extremely apologetic.
377-"It was SO busy a minute ago, we were SLAMMED," the one at the cash register explained.
378-The word "Poop" was engraved in huge letters right below the counter.
379-The cook pulled Art's dog from the fry basket, split it and threw it on the grill.
380-"It's deep-fried and grilled?"
381-I asked, because I couldn't believe it.
382-It was like a heart attack on a bun.
383-After a couple investigative bites, Art reported that he actually preferred Swanky Frank's single dose of grease, though the Rawley's dog also passed the crackly texture test, the bun was fresh and well-toasted and there was a generous amount of bacon draped over the dog.
384-I was still trying to interpret "snappy."
385-"Is it that feeling of breaking the seal with your teeth?"
386-I asked.
387-"Exactly," he said.
388-"I like that," I said.
389-"That's the thing.
390-It's so hard to judge hot dogs, because they're such a historical food in a person's life."
391-He gestured philosophically with his dog.
392-"People are fanatical about these.
393-This is the perfect hot dog if it's what you grew up with."
394-No one could get nostalgic about the fries, however, which were of the frozen, crinkle-cut variety, mealy and barely browned.
395-Dog: $2.40, Fries: $1.90         Super Duper Weenie 306 Black Rock Turnpike,Fairfield, 334-DOGS  I admit I was biased in favor of Super Duper Weenie to begin with for its name.
396-And if I had to eat off any of the linoleum-checked floors, this would be the one.
397-By now I was resigned that there were no take-out veggie dogs in my near future... when I spotted its cousin on the menu.
398-"How long have you carried veggie burgers for?"
399-I asked the cashier, who turned out to be one of the owners, Lorin.
400-"Since we opened," he said.
401-"But you don't have a veggie dog?"
402-"Veggie dog?
403-I can't say we've ever considered it."
404-He appeared to actually be contemplating the concept.
405-"Would you consider it?"
406-"I don't think they'd sell."
407-"Do the veggie burgers sell?"
408-"Yeah."
409-"So why wouldn't a veggie dog?"
410-"We're a greasy hot dog place."
411-"You could just try it out."
412-"We have tuna..."  "Please?"
413-"I'll think about it.
414-We've honestly never thought of it before."
415-Art surveyed his super duper dog.
416-Plentiful onions, two fat strips of bacon.
417-But I could tell his assessment by the face he made when biting down.
418-Snappy.
419-He liked the flavor of the meat, if not the texture, but Swanky Frank's was his personal overall favorite dog of the day, no question.
420-We agreed the fries were stellar--the best of the bunch by far.
421-Lots of skin, whittled-thin shapes, perfectly crisp with downy insides.
422-Lorin gave the batch a generous shake of pepper as well as salt.
423-Pepper on French fries!
424-Kind of nouveau cuisine for a former hot dog truck, don't you think?
425-I just know an animal-free frank is next...  Dog: $2.70 Fries: $2.25  Copyright  2004, Fairfield County Weekly          
           Here is a little introduction to a few of them     Soya : Soya is a good source of protein and low fat.

427-Is usually the basis for many meat substitutes.
428-Tofu  : Manufactured by a process similar to cheese making, but from soya milk.
429-Very good source of protein, calcium and low fat.
430-Able to take on flavours well  great for marinating.
431-Can be used for stirfries, kebabs, salads and just about anything savoury.
432-Tofu also is available in a silken form which is used for desserts, sauces or flans.
433-Quorn : Not made from soya but is a mycoprotein.
434-Made from the fermentation of a fungus, mixed with egg white.
435-Usually found as chunks, mince, fillets, burgers or sausages.
436-Outside North Ridge Hospital, the one that I know all the shortcuts to, I sit waiting for Triple A after hand holding in room 426 this time.
437-My grandmother is in again for rehydration.
438-This time it's been 8 days.
439-Today was by far the hardest.
440-I decided to reach across and hold her hand bruised, swollen, arthritis with gout, not really a hand anymore.
441-Years of sewing trusses, hunched over, and for low pay.
442-I suspect she won't be around much longer.
443-I think she has decided to let go.
444-After all, there is nothing left here for her but more pain and the missing husband of 53 years, now dead 13 months.
445-The past 6 have been reasonable considering her coherence is so limited but today she was there.
446-I saw in her eyes the same Grandmother who played games with me all summer long, put on plays, treated me like sugar on top of strawberries and now, me, child of 30 at her bedside; shriveled old woman the years were not kind to, wanting death knowing too full well now in my reaching out was saying to her from all of us for the first time the last time, you are forgiven.
447-Carnival   Oh, but to feel this good, this flushed face, your voice,  breathe, breathe.
448-I am hyperventalating.
449-I am electrified; blowing up like a balloon  and rising to the top of the tent past tight-rope walkers.
450-I rise up and through,  The canvas melts away to let me pass, and it's all stars and sliver moon,  up, up, up.
451-Accidental Rhyme   It comes out like this, running water against porcelain, into a glass, or bottle,  captured for espresso, mixed into soup, taken with vitamins, or with a $20 placebo when I am lucky.
452-It quenches my thirst or leaves me bloated.
453-When I jump up and down, I can hear it always inside me sloshing around.
454-Six Before Breakfast   Memories of wanting more and I left you the gift  of my sigh to ponder, getting the last word in before my power cut off,  denying all but me the right to caffeine.
455-Eight hours later, the work day spent, my smile shows no sign of setting into the horizon.
456-I wonder  will I wake to your words in the morning.
457-5:30 Wake Up Call   The dream ended abruptly, your voice on the line  and I couldn't roll over and turn it off, knowing time is too short to make decisions.
458-You tell me what love is;  unbroken speech, poetry before sun up and you tell me what love is;  again.
459-I listen, but there is more in my silence.
460-I listen, my inner abacus clicking and clacking against and over the crackling static that does not come from a clear connection;  and you tell me what I am afraid of;  again.
461-I have no time for these  parlor games;  cheap satoris leaving others open mouthed and astonished,  but not me.
462-I dealt those same cards eight and half years ago, my ego fed by those same eyes, that same hunger for confirmation seldom remembered the next day, and so the repetition continues.
463-You tell me what I want because you are afraid to hear the words from my lips and in an instant crack your mirror  or reflect something you will not remember tomorrow.
464-Kundalini Rizing   I am cross legged, spine growing, root to the ground; pushing it all towards the center and breathing deep light from below, from above, meets in the heart chakra up to the blue light shining,  lotus flower opening, growing, tickles like static electricity like the salt pepper atomic tv glow, chanelled, funneled up like a tube, suction, highcracking of stretching, straight then swaying  here, now.
465-Hello   Wanting to call you is pushing a hole right through, band-aid ripped from skin leaving a ring around the wound;  and the dancing visions, and the considerations, weighing, measuring,  and the wondering of how you would answer and would I get to read you this.
466-Margaret's Memorial   330 miles for the  privilege of holding my  Grandmother's hand  in the backseat as we drove  to the memorial service for her last  living friend.
467-RE: Alan   2:30 in the morning and my eyes aren't even  heavy yet;  your voice echoes in this room and from the cell phone;  poems read, traded; words swapped, meaning shared;  and I could be anyone.
468-Daniel says, "It sounds like you want to run off and join the circus."
469-I say I am already there.
470-Stolen Playgrounds   Tiger Woods' homeland stretches out across my field of vision.
471-I tell the woman to my right that 33% of all the water in Jacksonville must go to feed these lawns; a number pulled out of my ass, but possibly true.
472-Golfers spot the landscape like cat shit in litter.
473-I am thinking of the house off Stockton where I spent yesterday, crackheads bumming my clove cigarettes.
474-I am thinking of the neighborhood I wasn't supposed to walk in after dark and the kids I never saw playing outside.
475-The wind is blowing and inside the meeting space, people vend their wares to investment bankers and 5th hole wives.
476-I stub out my smoke and steal a pack of matches from the shiny, clean ashtray.
477-Out of Town Suit   Waiting for the others to join me at the meeting, I look over my shoulder, suspicious as I type  poetry, in my corporate suit and coffee at hand.
478-Later, the attendees arrive; two sets of eyes looking for leadership and direction, and all I want to do is get this down on paper,  barely able to contain my need to explain.
479-There are handouts and brochures scattered about, and nobody knows what's going on at this account.
480-I am watching them both for inspiration, the way he draws a wobbly arrow in his daytimer, or the laugh-hairflip combo from the woman across my way, beautiful and lost at 23.
481-I am taking control, and setting expectations.
482-I am the senior member at the table with no time for distractions.
483-Moments later, cell phones ring and the meeting is adjourned.
484-I open back up my laptop and type this.
485-Reverie   I'm not remembering my dreams just yet.

493-I absorbed you like a sponge, a bystander, the auctioneer, going, going...  but what could I offer you  in return, my body of work a messy string of cables and wires connecting everybody but me;  my body of work, a folder of pictures, from when I still dreamed of silver towers, the turbo elevator, and  eating at the company cafeteria like it was some kind of privlege.

510-Calling in later to listen and take dictation, I realize I can't hear a damn thing but the open window,  now just a memory alongside road side stands, boiled peanuts, and a sign for the state prison,  saying to myself for the first time that forever  is just a word.

521-In Due Time   Fantasies of writing again push me to discuss the option.

523-You can't make money he reminds, and so then there is a lot of suffering.

556-When the Moment Strikes   Suddenly you are lifted from the fog,  and all around and inside  is now.
557-Almost without warning, the picture sharpens;  and even name badges carry hidden meaning.
558-The words that come out are flushed with heart beat;  some truth to utter,  practicing for the real job that has yet to come;  but sits so close now on the edge of the river,  dangling its toes in the water.

576-It took the charts to bring out the rest.
577-Some Goddess   You said that, "I inspire you."

579-Listen, hon.
580-Epiphanies are not for barter.
581-I offer you nothing in trade.
582-You chose your muse long ago  (and it comes in a can.)
583-Don't misunderstand me.
584-I judge no one.
585-You chose your muse before I was even born;  and  perhaps a lesson for me  is to get off my ass and choose my own;  having learned in the end that love and working for the man ain't gonna cut it.

590-I am reaching for a pen.
591-I am looking for some paper.

600-roasted and splayed on the table, stuffing dribbling out of body cavities  when the eggs stopped coming   What magic mirror had the ovaries to tell her that everything she knew was a fairy tale?
601-And that that the rescue part   happily ever after   was something  she could have done herself in the end?
602-Survival Instinct   Mirrors crack, smashed to pieces, shards falling easily,  reflecting a face still used to control, eyes snapping up love  like a paper fan.

608-Who Art In Heaven   Hungry to believe that I was the one that asked the moon for forgiveness,  the story is repeated, perhaps for the third time.

620-Fort Lauderdale   Not ready to go back just yet; the stillness,  outside cool air; a smoke on the patio; the cats asleep peaceful vibe.
621-Dreaming of my Virgo man, who has not yet shown himself to me.

625-Curtains back, parrots in the sky, another cafe con leche, por favor.
626-The One That Stayed   Soft, her face against my face, cheeks touching,  smile, in her sounds, she is stretched, never changed, given without condition,  curling her body against my own as we drift to sleep.
627-Precipice   At the edge on the lion's back,  a glass of water shattered against the tile floor,  clouds open up, reveal the sun,  a paper envelope, greased with  tin, the rust stain,  hair collecting in the corners,  and you are still gone.
628-An Amazing Ten Minutes   heavy hung every second longer than day wider than sleep  waiting  unfold inside out  caught  spun into gold  spun into God meaning the cosmos this universe  This Week's Homework: "To be without attachment and without avoidance."
629-Maestro   Stronger, your words as though in a flash;  all that you have been, suddenly brilliant, focused, honest, hiding nothing.
630-Each word, heart beating, pulsing at the lines, spilling, eyes closed, tingling inner,  breathing slower, harder, with each line stanza grouped together; each more powerful than  my last, combining in elements, lining up for the last word;  shot into nothingness, never waiting to stop spinning.
631-Fortissimo   Sleep beckons, but your words read to me, for me, peal like bells in memory  and I wonder, prone to the condition, curious, demanding,  what will this do to your style;  already changed forever like me.

642-This time is no different.
643-Your goodbye leaves me  scattered pieces this heart I mended, I tended so carefully these past four months with papers signed.
644-And tears come like air and sobs are hard like the sprinter's gasp and I find no peace, no deep waters under this shaken surface.
645-So alone, and you refuse my love again and again.
646-I know you don't love me.
647-I felt it for six years, the unsurmountable task of communication.
648-We could find no network that could bring us together, no cables long enough or strong enough to channel the feelings.
649-And again and again I wait to hear what you can not say.
650-Maybe you think in your silence you do not hurt my feelings  as much as if I were to hear the truth.
651-Why is it like this between us?

662-The voice repeats in my head and on the audio tape I listen to at night, "Is it good for me?"
663-"Is it worth the price?"
664-Breathe deep, count down from 11 to 7.
665-"I am relaxed."
666-"I am calm."
667-"I am in control."
668-If I was going to reprogam my mind, for the moment that cravings come, I should have asked for orgasm or side splitting laughter instead.
669-Note to myself: Think bigger next time.
670-THE SEEKER   She begins from the top of the skyscraper, a pageless freedom knowing only the path down.
671-Delicious, fingers type, controlling the speed of descent, a rapture, while God is sought  in guarded temples with the Guru, among bacon eating Buddhists saying Om, with the Universalists teaching of prey and predator, and Christians lighting candles to remember.
672-She is still searching; books at her side are titled "Awareness" or "Transformation" and she scolds herself for not remembering her breath.
673-She has centered herself between the extremes for now and January is cold.
674-A waning gibbous moon streaks the green outside like frost  and meditation  is found in the details.
675-THE LAST WORD   Even as I reach my door, the drama of you continues; train whistle blow outside my window; and I cried out as we raced to catch the 5:40.
676-"Why does this have to be so dramatic?"
677-and he said,  "Heather, you wouldn't have it any other way."
678-Train whistle blows a last time, your meaning as you said goodbye, and I choosing myself at last over you.
679-What healing forms to take the place?
680-What warm bath of peace, a little gentle place to put the grief.
681-Back in my box, the hum of the computer, planes overhead dancing, low light, flannel against skin,  breathing again.
682-I will not be latched in any man's cage.
683-There is no combination to my love or lock to cut off.
684-I guard and protect my palace with curiosity, having learned the  art of questioning the witness, vicarious observation,  eating the emotions, dipping my bread and licking my fingers clean.
685-There is such a thing as too close and easy to spot amindst the blackness of eyelid curtains drawn.
686-Ignite into flame, sparks of wheels braking and every inside awakening.
687-This is the one I write for you inside my shallow cave of doubt and webs extending time across my space and death at every doorframe.
688-Damn you, the water that drowns itself, the air that suffocates, the fire leaving ash.
689-This earth can not bear these burdens nor count the weight of boxes shackled to ankles because you were afraid.
690-Step up and demand your rightful place.
691-Empty the barrels of regret and shame.
692-Throw the has been into the wind.
693-You have never been who you are right now.
694-And if I stamp my feet, and if I scream, then maybe you will leave me alone,  where I want to be, stepping aside.
695-And you will leave me Sorry China and all your prophesies fulfilled at last.
696-And I will tell my story into nothingness and remember nothing.
697-I will gesso over the canvas, press the delete button, and move on,  because that is what I do well.
698-And if I think it hurts for just a moment, I will blame the moon.
699-And if you think truth is known when it is named, you are missing the picture.
700-There is no truth, just images from electrons that flash and burn oblivion soup.
701-THE REVIEW(S) IS/ARE IN   The words are out in print for comment or not, and the judgement is not guilty  for now.
702-Decision hangs steady for three days running with little deviation in the story line.
703-Simple fool to be nothing better than or just something overlooked again.
704-The wonder of it all and the knowing is like a path.
705-I stopped on the walk, dropped to my knees and counted, curled like a fist, waiting for the moment past passed.
706-DISILLUSION MEANT   The moon plays tricks on my peace of mind and I am happily surprised by Pisces Balsamic curl of light.
707-Surprise is always happy.
708-Intentional change may present a few road blocks.
709-Tested and teased, I left my worries on the Bahamas  breeze, the sidewalk balcony outside my room with the mini golf view, and the buffet extravaganza.
710-The time to leave signals, a flash of lightening and the thunder is a smile.
711-Nine years passed without the pantyhose battle once brought into the open.
712-I wore flats and rose colored glasses in defiance of no one but myself in the end.
713-My reasons have changed but my soul has remained strong.
714-I have finally found the path I have been walking on all along.
715-WHEN YOU LEARNED OF MY NAME   10 years ago was me to this place and nothing mattered much but that I could drink and the liquor store so close to my house and Food Lion for beer.
716-Still I wrote with feriocious intensity; love lost and forlorn of fantasies never formed.
717-And memories too; the drunken pounding of fingers to the keyboard on my new color screen computer.
718-I can remember sending you the poems though I can't remember which ones they were or what you might have known when you learned of my name.
719-I was anybody else at the time and you didn't know about all of the wine or how I came to men or who was why I am.
720-And I didn't know you were someone real housed in a castle of empties casting your net onto the page from the Dead Man's chair.
721-Conversations ensued we can not even remember, memory not being too important as the holy now and even now that is so.
722-There is no time and yet enough time, all of the world's time and no roles or expectations to grow one's hair long or shave off a beard.
723-Who we are now and what has been heard when nothing was said,  but still I wonder does he know and I hear him in my mind saying yes a thousand times I am saying nothing so loud, and even covering my smile poker faced as the dream is coming forward and the painting of the moon is mine and that school and that park and that is exactly yes and all the ashes in my car or the bowl of vomit left two days now at the foot of the table is nothing compared to nothing compared to nothing compared to.

    CONFIDENCE   I am water.
725-I am earth.
726-My parents were fire and air.
727-I was pulled from the womb unwilling to face the birth canal when another option was possible.
728-It is always possible.
729-I come to you now on the verge of discovery.
730-My sails are flowing and I am confident of this wind and this salt air, the canvas blowing filling with colors.
731-This confidence is like a gift and I appreciate and I endure;  weaving the strands into patterns into make believe and real and something warm to wear.
732-Life came to me  in summer and footy pajamas.
733-The fourth generation, baby Polish princess at the top of the aluminum siding castle.
734-There was a picnic table in the back yard.
735-And my mother was air could she make them like her more by liking me enough.
736-And my father was fire over books and bad kitchen lighting to hook a career out of this place where he too was born.
737-We fled to the desert when I was three leaving snows behind and the oven my grandmother used to burn her children's hands with when they were bad.
738-A new set of grandparents welcomed me like a second birth and there was a kitten for a friend, soon a pool, and a million books of witches and goblins and girls who knew magic.
739-My mother stayed inside with romance novels and melon ballers and sometimes gin and vermouth but always perfect; coming outside with cut up vegetables and hours working to please the palette of my Dad.
740-She knew her role.
741-She was air.
742-She passed through.
743-And when I was good I was very very good and when I was bad I was horid.
744-Sweat pulled off in the dry heat like mirage as I waited for my father to get home to punish me for something done again to my mother.
745-He was fire.
746-She was air and I was earth and water.
747-The tension and terror of the beating and having to do whatever she said or else.
748-This much I remember and nothing more will come to this page today.
749-I am lifted from the story in a giant helium balloon and carried up up up to the stars and evening night as the sunset hits camelback mountain and saguaros turn purple with goodnight.
750-(written 6:10 PM Saturday, April 12, 2003) 
    GLASS   Light filtered through stained glass cave dwellings,  cool earth floor,  among the red rocks and chips of light break through like points on a map  when everything is warm and kind.
751-The rock is smooth in my hand, now edges jagged are merged with palm, tendered with lotion and love from all around, and above, beyond, below, beneath, besides, concerning, down, during, except, for, from.
752-The prepostion parade with clown horns and Shriners whizzing down the streets and squares of Savannah during the St. Patrick's Parade;  and your apartment window two floors above the porta potty while people pissed green;  your stryrofoam head doll painted magical Mona and no idea of direction.
753-There was only the wind and the dandylions catching, scattering, dispersing, dancing.
754-Did we dance last night outside Nicotine, didgeridoo pulsing notes and I interrupted you to trace the painted footsteps, fucked up the numbers and turned towards you watching me learning.
755-But the clouds pass casting shadows layered like stacks of napkins spread in a fan at the bar; swizzle sticks, a rotating fan.
756-The film is rolling and nothing but everything I ever wanted stands in the way of here and now.
757-Already the vine is curling tender shoots reaching up like pipe cleaners to twist and play with suck on like ponytail braids and twirl around in the dress like every damsel in distress.
758-Good god.
759-May there be light, may there be inner peace and spritual growth for every one of these fuckers like me and you and everybody playing it cool or emptying giblets from paper packages to put in soup to flavor the broth.
760-I am down with mines and shoulds and sighs.
761-I have enough belief in myself to let it ride 'cause if the worst is down, that is what I am good at.
762-Spring is here.
763-Step outside.
764-(written 5:51 PM Saturday, April 12, 2003) 
    DISJOINTED   Who am I to tell you to stay and master the infinite complexities of unknown now  when power struggles weigh heavy on the scales shucked off with a borrowed knife and shining in the early light like rainbow fingernails  the missing piece is always missing or it would not be a piece  there are no stand alones or one offs or this or that creation to believe in something better different new  dreams are analyzed and shown on television for the masses wanting reality when truth does not connect them  soft edges the day at home incapable of being the listener to act alone  what purpose vision or adjustment or rain from these clouds heavy and boxes stacked like waiting for something grander or a kick in the ass never coming from one's own foot 
    DAYLIGHT SAVINGS   Fire does not sit well with me alone in this room still  and sweat is hanging like a heavy too big to hold child  in this room humid airless  and I could go open the windows  and I could turn on the air  but no and not and suffer this martyr I am not satisfied with all of my choice with all of my everything told I can do whatever I want as wanting makes  as desire fufills  as comfort shields my eyes I see nothing but blind  as routine paves my sidewalk I feel nothing under foot  as more advice to stay to not risk to not dare or dream or trust or live  all of the voices stop I have heard all the words from inside before  and this is just another hole and it's for me to decide something new and not worry about right 
    404   In an instant this one was gone in a blank nothing of return key silence  having filled the virtual page with words so cleansing and even on this one the ending was fabulous  but something happened page cannot be displayed this blog sever down  despair my words were not retained 
    EXPLAINING THE SILENCE   Three months passed with nothing much to say being on a power high and all or at least thinking I was but the pixie dust washed off in the turpentine bath and all that was left was dirty feet  The answer was not found in that question.
765-I must have been asking the wrong but how could I know and what made me think and maybe if and what about that and should I shouldn't I would I could I  trust myself to even trust the universe as though stars represent some kind of why enough to make us feel small and I say  no again not this time  running jump and slide  your whole life is this dive down down deep 
    APPEARANCE   PMS makes more sense than another 10 years of this goddamn job everyone says is so great because it pays the bills  so it goes  as he'd say  as for me I have had enough  as for me my last never is worked  I'd have to be out of my mind to stay another minute  I'd have to be drugged and sacked in burlap  Even that sounds like more fun than another drive on the turnpike  back and forth endlessly  making someone look good 
    IT ALWAYS COMES TO THIS   the moment of flight  people parachutes  a lead weight a helium balloon  whispers from an alley a stern glance of disapproval  acceptance the unknown  trust shame  the ego's despair  clutching grappling and dusting off  the cape 
    I CRADLE IF   I cradle If and dress her up like dolls for girls to play with  I hold her hand at the end of the street and look both ways before crossing  Late at night I tuck her in with When and How beside her  If I were If I'd never know fuck is this cadence or what is this shit that's happening 
    CROSSROADS   Pounding breath is shallow body thick and hard with tense hammering desire to quit to flee to love to be to stop copying and start creating to move on and find the path is still there winding to another crossroads somewhere further on 
    RSVP   Busting out a tickle pins and needles inside below the rib cage  the urge is so strong to live to create to be become feel free  liberated at last  something unknown magnetic tractor beam pulling me towards the next step  life mapped out and the bread crumbs eaten by forest animals  body draped on the massage table while my neck is pulled and pushed left center right  scolded for wearing my shoulders around my neck and the woman's pecs forgotten  hunching over from too much keyboard caressing  my fingers begin to curl  until at last reminded  death does not have to come by invitation 
    DIALOGUE WITH YOURSELF   Did you expect to find me here in this location starting out at you  and we I mean you and I being you  you feel who you are talking to who is talking to you from behind these fingertips ever pressing and there is nothing but the abyss of bytes spewing data like stars the universe expanding exploding consciousness in batches recorded here for all to see  like blindness like turning away and what is visual is what is coming to screen  and I am alive here and with you as much as you will let me be  there is brightness illumination signalling and like a race to the finish  you are with me now and who am I but you 
    ALCOHOLIC   Weak, you drink your strength and become fermented and sour like substance, forever kicking yourself and those you love sober when you are a gentle man;  hard to remember when words are thick as phlegm, subtle as lead pipes against the head;  dissapointing like a lesson unasked for, unlearned,  and all that you were slips through fingers like the water from a poem somebody else wrote who thought he was you.
766-BETRAYED   2:19 am birthed the Aries moon  while sleeping in my bed.
767-The morning broke through and I wake  to moving sidewalks, the others passing by and standing, and staring, until workday is done.
768-I leave the crowd behind to shuffle off  this day's remorse, unmet, unmatched.
769-Daylight is sucked in  by the mouth of night, inhaled, one gulp,  embers, coals;  and it begins, the nightly ritual, a different sidewalk.
770-In the moment, you are all light and anything can happen;   does.
771-You break the spell.
772-You cast a shadow.
773-You are bitter and darker, fire and ice  side by side; driving me  to write.
774-You are a comfort to none but the man at the gas station who sold you the cans  and I am the fool again, manipulated, talked about, lied about, tossed around  like worth  as you  piss all over your fan club.
775-FINISHED   That's it.
776-I have had enough of trying to relate, to change the world, to change myself, to make a difference, to make a dent.
777-BOOM  Let hope explode.
778-BOOM  Fireworks of faith.
779-BOOM  There's nothing left.
780-I have wasted my life living someone else's dream, someone else's expectations.
781-BOOM  I should be burned at the stake for treason.
782-BOOM  I should be nailed to the cross for my thoughts, kept inside again, repressed inside again, silent, useless, lonely, ugly, nothing golden bright to offer the universe.
783-BOOM  Time is running through my fingers and I don't have the answers, these dubloons are melted chocolate stale Easter leftovers, and I am going to hell anyway for tempting married men when I had none of my own, for speaking out too seldom, for dragging my kindness through the coals like it's nothing, like I am nothing to offer but down  while the wheels spin and the roar of the plane, and the polite way the passengers ignore eachother even when someone is screaming.
784-(written 4/27) 
    STAND BY   Disillusioned I soar, a bird who has clipped her own wings, finding at last that I have no fire to offer the universe; it was yours all along.
785-Alone now I hide, with my gifts unwrapped, bowless, as if the universe cared for another utopian dream, a direction of love pointed to with an open heart by a mute.
786-And if my tears could turn this dry earth to mud, and if my soil could change the world, then throw me to the flame and let my ashes proof the clay between your hands.
787-I am nothing.
788-I am no one, at last the liquid poured into sieve of self and gone.
789-What good is the desire to serve when desire only cuts and divides both halves.
790-There are pieces of me I will leave behind here, leaving my dreams unfulfilled, my faith in myself crushed by a fist, rumpled into a ball and tossed with so much other rubbish.
791-So this I will tell you when your voice is back, that I have failed, that I have faltered, that I have gazed into the mirror and reflected none of what you have seen, vision pissed into balloons and cast into the sea.
792-I am a whimper.
793-I am a moth not a dragon, weak, withdrawn, to retreat to the cage of my fingers, to lock the door without a key.
794-And in the end, if one will come, I will remember nights without sleep, the weight of my passion, the pounding belief at my door that knocked and knocked and knew no peace.
795-My back was strong and inside much light, but thought orbits like stars, like earth around sun, the moon which never came, and no certainty as I watched my picture fade.
796-I knew at any time even now, I could stand, make a decision, and be strong again, bone and blood, but feelings like magnets hold me to this chair, and it is more true not to move now.
797-Like faucets, like data through cables and I divert my eyes from danger like God's house or salvation, rather inside believing failure when uncertain success may come.
798-I resign my position of mood director.
799-I relinquish my smile at strangers, my mind the master, brandishing the whip at every indescretion or indecisive move.
800-It hangs in my solar plexus like indigestion.
801-I have squandered my power.
802-I have trusted that I could be you and made promises I can not keep.
803-I have buried myself with a toy shovel and lost my place and lost my way.
804-I spin and spin to gather speed, bursts of  dull light, explosions of average, my ego kicks and screams echoing down the well.
805-I will forgive no one, not myself, nor you, nor all of those gardners planting hope and despair.
806-Not even weeds could sprout through baked desert cracks in my soul.
807-Even the cactus gave up on rain and shriveled to a stick, thorns still sharp.
808-Nothing to guess at now, reality unveiled, my pathetic escape plans scrawled over  This is my weakness.
809-Look at the man behind the curtain now, gaze upon her face.
810-I will ask none of you for help or hinderance, you have suckled me on lies foolish needy trusing lips to nipple, and the dead weight  of my aspirations, and the bullshit faith in my abilities, and the tears that well up now,  unable to keep it together  even for the hour and a half plane ride home.
811-(written 4/27) 
    OFF THE HOOK   It's not even nine when there is an attempt to cop-opt my crisis; my story at last told, and everything hangs in air like dreams are not even possible.
812-The day passes in sleep and the strain of listening to numbers talk, screaming down columns in an Excel spreadsheet 5 cups of coffee can not even animate.
813-Freedom charges another debit against my account and the messenger hits the floor before the bullets fly.
814-(written 5/21) 
    BEFORE AND AFTER    The rain taps its fingers on the tin roof above my patio,  keeping me from a drive North to  Melbourne to check in, luggage in hand,  another night out  before  a morning meeting, and a few words, and a few notes, and a  drive West to  Tampa to check in, luggage in hand, and   another night out.
815-FOR PHIL   You took a photo of me in stars, black back, and rain dripping down the screened porch.
816-You gave me comfort but I could not receive.
817-There were too many thoughts of goodbyes from others ringing in my ears for me to hear what you were saying.
818-I am surrounded by the aged and forget my youth from time to time.
819-IN VAIN   There is nothing I have to say that hasn't been felt by someone else and this is my good fortune.
820-All of the angst and doubt and questions are not in vain if written down and someone should pick up the pieces to rest her head a while.
821-Some nights it is not so easy to sleep without a pillow.
822-WILLING   And out of nowhere and everywhere, all is right with the universe and you are back.
823-I am green haired, laughing, young, hanging on the swimming pool ladder, catching my breath as yours whispers through the line.
824-Every moment, back and new in the complexity of an almost no.
825-I understand without.
826-You remind me so much with every word how yes there is a now, there is a connection we all experience down, and because such love is required, such tenderness that I know from you for everyone in your gentle stories.
827-The magic you convey is possible in the moment, every moment.
828-I am singing in these words.
829-I am dancing the steps painted on the sidewalk.
830-Take my arm in yours.
831-I am willing.
832-CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE   Silence starting and already I imagine trips to the mailbox, but what the fuck, and why  am I missing something here that has kept my mouth shut tight like duct tape over lips against a terrorist threat.
833-Light another.
834-Smoke another.
835-Get this out of my head and down where I can understand nothing better than big talk from someone else,  while I sit and observe, while I sit and perceive.
836-I am whipped into submission by my reflection.
837-My tawdry alter ego, the no show, readied for my finale as a failure and no head for numbers, so what will become of me...
838-I have three days left before I can be myself again and nobody will be there on the other side to hear it.
839-What have I done and why should I care if I don't don't care when I'm my own nurse writing prescriptions, before the Third Bardo.
840-For all the promises made to send to me, now will the letters come?
841-What do you care and why should you care when I am just another stranger or reminder that you have heard everything before and probably said much better.
842-Is that jealousy?
843-I have nothing to offer but breath and that which comes natural to dissipate every energy landing here.
844-Doubt, fear, shame.
845-This is nothing to contribute and I can't get by on my tits, my looks faded at 5 years old and I'm lucky to hear cute anymore.
846-Responsible, dependable me.
847-Why can't I just be alone where no shadows play across the walls I don't cast myself.
848-Why can't I just be alone and not hear your voice or wonder and wait by the mailbox for something not coming out here now to tell me the truth.
849-4:05 AM Friday, June 27, 2003 
    HOW DARK   This dramatic ending was courtesy of T-Mobile.
850-Sixty seconds on Bradley's phone explained nothing.
851-I am a greyhound let loose after the rabbit, carting your newest disciple behind me.
852-Thoughts of this and who I am spark, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.
853-Back at home, wondering who this father he thinks you are is, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.
854-Pieces fly and the jig saw changes the shape on the way down.
855-I am powerless watching this story play out in not the way I feel.
856-And I question every question I questioned and the answers that sound different the second time rewound, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.
857-The line to you is cut and words can only get me into trouble later or sooner if I send them.
858-This is not my half.
859-This is not my whole.
860-This is not my job, my problem, my passion, my possession.
861-I am lightning.
862-Look at the path.
863-I am the moon reflected in a pail.
864-Look up.
865-All my words and all my sorrows have already been taken, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.
866-Go ahead and choose another title for this  meaning less.
867-It will take longer to explain the sound of my own voice this time.
868-2:55 AM Friday, June 27, 2003 
    HEATHEN   These are not the keys I wanted to press 65 days in.
869-This is not the Sunday afterwards I wanted to spend with you.
870-I am a balloon that's been deflating for years.
871-Nobody said anything.
872-Isn't now too late to raise my hand for air?
873-This is not the song I expected to be playing for you this month.
874-This is not the book I wanted to read when I finally let go.
875-What makes you think you are so special?
876-What gives you the right to judge and complain?
877-I am a television series all to myself.
878-I want to tell my friends to stop right where they are and let me get this down on paper or where is that camera, tape recorder, something.
879-This is what I am supposed to remember.
880-Interesting is even better than saved.
881-BETWEEN THE NOTES   I remember talking with you at the table, you in your assigned place, and me in mine, even though the parents were gone.
882-You told me I was too young to think about things like the meaning of life,  or what my purpose here  would be.
883-You are supposed to be out having fun, you told me, and I would ask you  what if thinking about these things was my idea of fun.
884-I could barely convince myself and you never hid your pity for my petty struggle to find and an answer.
885-between the notes in our conversation.
886-EQUINOX   Tommorrow is off, put on hold; faith, hope, and love are shelved cans of film, and the jar of ideas is filled with brine awaiting  a different  freedom.
887-This summer equinox knocks to find me barely awake at its passing and  cursing the light that won't heal another's suffering.
888-It has rained all day and you tell me 600 persons were evacuated in the flooding when we talk.
889-There are no fire flies this far into the city anyway and even if the grasses were dry the crickets would not grind any softer.
890-I have been promised that the meaning of life is time by an uncle I got drunk a dozen Christmasses ago.
891-I immerse myself in it like a bath of gravy and barely float.
892-I shovel the walk of it every morning when I wake and notice its passing when the last quarter moon rises behind the clouds.
893-Decades too young to retire from life, I give up anyway.
894-I stand accused of dreaming of a world too good  to be real.
895-Evidence is presented without a spell check in great abundance for the good of the masses.
896-They tell me their fears and wish me well enough alone, trapped in prisons of their own regret.
897-I stand inside my cell tonight because I know my way around here even in the dark.
898-WRITING   Always arriving like an itch nothing can scratch;  not mind, nor hopes, nor mindless cleaning, straightening for the the creation that comes from fingertips,  The night is longer still ahead of me, like wine, like water from glasses played for an audience;  different levels of liquid to appoximate the voice or a guitar left playing by itself, fingers strumming with nobody to hold the instrument.
899-VIGIL   There are moments when joy doesn't come and all of the talk of God and peace does not fit the hole.
900-Even faith in the internet shatters under search terms not found.
901-The emptiness is vast without content.
902-The void is highlighted in gold and  over and over again outside it sounds like thunder or the sound of trash cans rolled out for the night, planning for the morning when time stands on end, static electricity in hair, the gong sounds.
903-Time's up.
904-PRINCESS   Sometimes she can sweep the pages into nothingness; into an eight ball corner pocket, stuffed with her short attention span for present details.
905-The past ruffles its feathers against  the girl with a lifetime (still short) of boxes filled with collections of what  can not be bought.
906-Dreams may come, and she may call names  out into the darkness like memory cares enough to answer her at all.
907-She asks if true love is as real as stars or bright  planetary nebulae, a fuel that burns to tell us something  about our own origins.
908-All remembered at once, it is sudden as  dissapoint ment  and the gravity of a single misplaced thought, found still searching for the pea under her matress.
909-WORKAHOLIC   Another sun sets as you stab at your keyboard, fingers drumming replies to the boomerang burst of emails you must answer.
910-In only a few moments, the time for dinner will have passed, all movies will have already begun, and all of your friends will be in the thick of their plans for the night.
911-You may believe in the urgency of the greater cause the company has instilled in you, and the idea  of your place in this world from which there is no  clocking out.
912-So wake at dawn to work but know in the end it is nothing.
913-The time will come where death  will rock your boat, the loss of a loved one  leaving an anchor deep under your waves, and you will wonder where all those sunsets went and why you were not there to hold her hand at starlight.
914-You will find that all those trips for work meant nothing, are not even remembered, and even the money left behind is too weak to keep you floating.
915-Begin to tread now, and gather your strength.
916-Pick up your sail and work with the wind this time, for love is more than greed will ever buy.
917-You will never be important enough or have enough proof of your worth through any job or any title.
918-It is quicksand to your self and no matter how much it eats of your soul it will never be full.
919-Forgive yourself the times you made others do your work so you could ride the corporate coaster.
920-Forgive yourself the times you couldn't be there because you thought you were too important.
921-Forgive yourself now for truth does not come easy and without a lesson.
922-There are many oceans ahead of you to call your home now that you know.
923-AFTER A DAY AT HOSPICE   How slowly these stages pass, how gradual a slope, and we too are learning while the summer passes by without our concern.
924-The days lengthen and stretch beyond us while we too  are blanketed by the nurses in kindness and patience.
925-With Grandma there are moments where she lets me know  with the grip of her hand, she is still here.
926-Sometimes there is a smile, beautiful beyond skies.
927-There have been days too where she has comforted me when weak,  my tears falling unashamed by my love for this woman who has given me so much acceptance and concern, a gentle respect for simple truths.
928-I remember weeks ago, hot from the walk to the Hospice house, I came to her and took her hands in mine.
929-With silence she drew them  to her lips  to blow them cool.
930-This is love.
931-It is here I have learned tenderness.
932-It is here I have learned care.
933-These are my thoughts riding my bike home, thanking my legs, my heart, my health.
934-Home, I hesitate doing what would make me feel good because even the tension in my  shoulders,  neck,  face, reminds me that  you are still here.
935-There is so little time now  for other souvenirs; memories made, forgiveness granted,  and night passes on to another day of lessons and farewells.
936-ONLY IN DREAMS   Why must love be for another when it can not be against?
937-Last week I was your lover, wife, favorite friend, and child's mother.
938-You came to my door with words I long to hear, having scripted them so meticulously, missing nothing.
939-We spoke from the heart and dreamed in color, filling the skies, traveling through deserts and on high mountain roads.
940-I gave you the resume of my heart, objective clear, and you responded in delight.
941-Pity you were not there to experience any of it.
942-Why must love be for another when it can not be against?
943-BEFORE THE CREDITS   Maybe the answer is to belong nowhere; let time ride over your back like rain falling through a patch of sun, sing your song into the night to harmonize with locusts, breathe, embrace moments even spent in woods, and if a tree falls then who cares.
944-There have been crueler summers, the time to let my heart out to play, learning there is beauty too in suffering.
945-I am more than less I was as dogs bark and the room is still save the ceiling fan having it's own gentle caress on my shoulders.
946-I bleed willingly, joyfully, believing in magic over cold logic and thoughts dancing, meaning nothing.
947-Real is as real does.
948-The movie playing in my mind is a double feature.
949-I order vegetable foo young and select this seat.
950-THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE   For seven years I have lived next door to a mermaid.
951-At night, she hangs her tails from the line stretched across her car port.
952-I know her name and she knows mine.
953-The rest of my neighbors are strangers, stranger still these days filling spaces with SUVs and children taken in hand.
954-I have outgrown this home and am outclassed, and am outmortgaged, and am outside taking the recycling out for Friday wondering how it all got so different from me.
955-CUT THE STRING   I imagine I will always have this feeling of vague dissastisfaction.
956-One minute there is endless opportunity, the goal is in sight, then the finish line, then nothing left to cross.
957-I remind myself.
958-Another ending is near, and in the end it doesn't ever matter how good it all sounded then.
959-I have people to face and balls of yarn to unravel, trim, and snip off.
960-Perfection isn't possible and what are dreams for if not to wake from.
961-I seek a new path to absorb myself into.
962-I will avoid those who suffer from self-importance this time.
963-I have paid for my admittance to this show in more ways than one.
964-July is change and letting go and the universe seems a lot more trustworthy to me than people if I am any example.
965-The balloon rises into the sky and is caught by the wind up, up, up.
966-CLOSER   Holding in feelings, drawn and quartered by possible fantasies and improbable futures, I am in wonder and awe.
967-She gave me a sample bottle of perfume called Miracle to use for such adventures but so far no water has turned to wine.
968-I am beside myself, inside myself, rehearsing and rehashing, afraid to pick up the phone to call you in the event it may ring.
969-You are living in a different time I know too well to pretend now my minutes pass the same as yours, measured for mixing in metric increments.
970-The window of opportunity this time is known and days pass towards your arrival as though leaning forward.
971-I am unsure about all but my feelings and what I am willing to sacrifice in their name.
972-Such statements come easy but I am all about the imagined.
973-It is what I know, eyes full of stars, and an inner knowing of just how the moon will look tonight rising above water.
974-GO ON   For five days, I have been without my mirror.
975-I guess if this shirt looks right with this skirt with this look, sideways glancing, is this really me?
976-It is spring at the piata party.
977-My amnesia has lifted  from the time I was hit by the bat.
978-I am looking around at all the kids.
979-Tonight even the poet asks where the moon is and in Gemini, even I look rational.
980-Thoughts stretch out in the sun and flip.
981-Everyone else has found the answers but me.
982-I have spent my life interviewing the wrong  person.
983-STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS   If I could quiet my thoughts, wrap the bundle in  soft and warm, to crib for naps or watching stars,  would the unknown make itself a little less obvious?
984-All day I have been beyond behind wonder and not knowing, pretending bliss,  the gift of lack of commitment.
985-I am too far removed and too soon confused.
986-I am missing out on missing out.
987-Could there be a balance in geography, a new spot to look on the map, easier on the neck?
988-Snap around and fall  in line?
989-I am breaking the rules still but  still not enough.
990-And in a round, my generation sings.
991-We apologize to all of those who have sacrificed their lives in the hope we would be more than what we have become.
992-You should have asked us first what we were capable of.
993-GROWING WINGS   Like an outpouring from the void, not even knowing what will be said next, it all comes together in a chorus of what to dos.
994-The eternal question of being strong enough for someone else too, you ask without a question mark.
995-There is always fear of never being enough for these mistakes offered up like proof.
996-I have not turned the air conditioner on since I have been home, a someplace I have been before, which surrounds me like a fog that does not come up through the trees at seven o'clock in the morning.
997-CLUES AND ILLUSIONS   At this point it doesn't really matter what I say to sound coming off like a nothing, something, maybe more or less, not.
998-These images flash, and I am unsure again of who I  was when I was what I was,  to be found this close to home without a conscience carved in honest mistakes.
999-Best wait for something resembling silence to take the place of feeling out of place, pointed at.
1000-No competition is worth having.
1001-We were meaning something even I can't understand;  like a song going through your head that won't quit and singing it to someone else only makes it worse.
1002-A spotlight on the stage or behind walls is more or less the same.
1003-Burn out the light by leaving it on too long or shadow this crevasse into camouflage.
1004-It makes no difference.
1005-Words must come out somewhere after all and targets are slow to come by.
1006-To know oneself as a monster and angel containing equal parts is a poorly bargained balance.
1007-Deny nothing.
1008-Keep to yourself.

    AND THEY ARE OFF   I write without stopping like someone has shot a gun and the race is on.
1029-To be fair, I allow for breaks this time.
1030-To be proper, I forgive those  critics whose  jobs were to set me straight on a number of important details  such as;  creativity is all well and good but keep within the established rules,  and  love is a blessing even when you don't exactly have it in the way that you thought about it,  and hey what about a little fucking humor  from time to time to break through.
1031-Because I have gone back now in time and read your words,  and they were not meant even for me here feet on table, legs slagging over the edge, cigarette smoked, and getting smaller again, as I am want  to do once I get too full of myself.

1036-It wasn't all that and in the end less mattered than I might have thought once I awakened to the reality of who I was sleeping inside those realtor looking jackets and sweating leather flats I kept in abundance in the trunk of my car in case I were to forget to wear shoes to work again.
1037-written 8/4/03 4:12 am

1038-I claimed the walls as my own still refusing birth.
1039-Inside, I asked the others to tell me the truth and they did.
1040-They were too slow to come up with any questions for me and nobody could match my hours of practice asking questions into the void, the abyss that fed me mother's milk while I scrawled marks on the walls to measure time.
1041-It's all here, all of my secrets revealed again, and if I forget another time then yes, again, I will seal the capsule with packing tape one more time and cast my bottle into the sea.

1045-Sometimes it pricks like a pebble  in an ice skate laced up tight, buried layers  deep down in the sock.
1046-You never really cared  to own your own laughter or delight shared with others still fearing their own shadows, but La Ventana is open wide, proof enough that water can wear down the earth.

1060-Relinquish the lust for results, acknowledging the answers given you didn't ask for.
1061-Nothing can slip through fingers, even held tight, like impatience when a tunnel is bored into the earth or the flesh for a break through centuries overdrawn.
1062-ON PURPOSE   In times of fear, we all fall back on what we think we know to be our strengths when our weakness  makes us more human.
1063-In a robot vision of life, in step with the crowd or with those breaking free, all of the indecisions are abandoned for better distractions.
1064-In the microwaveable vision of life, time is saved by not wondering purpose or planning for trips not yet taken;  and everyone has answers they are willing to share.

1070-Creativity is for what practical purpose anyway or should that question anchor  elsewhere.

1072-What if you were the answer?
1073-What if you were the center?
1074-Commitment is  even harder to make to ones self than  to another when stubbornly, the dream refuses to let go when the alarm clock goes off, and  still nothing to do on purpose.
1075-WAVE PARTICLES   Tired of sustaining the illusion, she cracks another whip and the music resumes,  Lonlied by me, my and mine, she parts the waves  to bring the boats to shore a prettier face  could have launched into battle.

1084-THE MOON WAS STILL UP   Anger and pain I can not understand because they are so far underneath your skin even poetry does not release from you their rewards.
1085-You compete against the music played to drown you out on purpose as though guitar light could flood the landscape yesterday bright or for pieces of the puzzle glued on cardboard to signify an end.
1086-Struggle is synthesized into the equalizing waves of water washing over a brand new day and you are the  lighthouse again against rocky shores.
1087-Memory unlatches the paper petroglyphs at exactly the right time even though the words are too faint to hear over the lyrics of Van Morrison or the possibility of being completely wrong about all of it.
1088-DISSEMINATING ARIES   Even though the night fades, I hold the connection like sunrise sings the moon to sleep and drives truth into hiding for memories of future hopes of meaning.
1089-Nothing has come true yet but it doesn't matter.
1090-As long as there is breath to explain the similarities of shadows passed in misdemeanors of youth's lost excuses for being someone.

1094-Not everyone was famous in their past lives and some of us even are supposed to be who we are exactly as we are right now regardless of who likes it, and those that do.
1095-Those who will be with us always are no less worthy of lifting up into truths known by all to be remembered by some.
1096-The burden of keeping silent is celebrated only at the first sign of sound.
1097-And though there may be more than nothing to it, I am found here in your loss more than you were known to be like me, straightening my spine as rainbows climb my back.
1098-BACK AND FORTH   There have been truths told and promises broken over and over again like time passes through street corners summer has neglected and passed her judgment on before songs stop the conversations going nowhere.
1099-The middle path is a reminder and echoes fly like hawks high above La Ventana calling me home as time is marked in different countries.
1100-Over everything and nothing, no blame comes; the farewells are predicted in tea leaves, the strained voice of someone knowing there is nothing so something as the peach tree orchard of lost virginities and misled suitors looking for magic, rabbits dead in the hat.
1101-The next song starts on speaker phone and she is beyond understanding his control or the drummer boy playing in the background without frankincense or louder still to drown out fingers stretching across time.
1102-He asks her if she has found enlightenment yet or if she knows what love is.
1103-In this state or that.
1104-with control, or without control, or with the knowing glances, the smiles at men with chests pressed out.
1105-The owl that came to her on the patio looked in her eyes for truth before the matter was examined, and we heard the same music for the first time pretending it was not the second time this has not happened before or it was not the first time this has happened again before  air on the neck, the ceiling fan, the fan on the floor, the wind that calls from canyons in Farmington, secrets of not giving yourself completely enough over until the end.
1106-MILAREPA'S DANCE   Maybe dreams are just the  overreaching of money's excuse for not being real enough or owning pain rented out.
1107-My grandmother was dying as the paid nurse held her hand and  I asked my Mother if this is what money buys.
1108-In silent shame I knew  the truth no books  are bold enough to hold  the words for.
1109-I am born of this wound made in the earth by accident.

1111-I look to the sky for the moon rising, reliable as egg letting go of womb.
1112-She is the woman he is looking for and he doesn't believe she exists.
1113-Even still her hands stretch out, thumb and forefinger holding the fragile peace.
1114-Even still her breathing lights up the room darker than he knows reaching out in ways he can not see, can only feel and she understands.
1115-I COME TO THE DESERT   I come to the desert  to find my past, reconnect with roots  buried in hard soil played on in childhood, Creosote smells foretelling distant rain the heat evaporates before landing.
1116-I come to the desert  to find my past, branches of my heart dried like cactus bones, asking acceptance from this earth or these Indian eyes, or these Mexican smiles, who glance over me like forgiveness is all I can earn here under this white skin.
1117-White like klan robes, white like eyes opened wide, white like lies told for victories never won in justice.
1118-I come to the desert  to find my past at the National Atomic Museum, and learn about Nobel scientists, skin mushroom cloud white like mine, and I am demanding to know the half-life of truth.
1119-I come to the desert  to find my past at the Pueblo museum in plaques defining 19 tribes, each with a paragraph describing their survival among the greed of conquerors using God as a weapon with skin white like mine.
1120-I come to the desert to find my people at the museum  of Hate and Intolerance, but the gates are closed, guarded by silent kachinas skin bright and bold, not white like mine.
1121-I come to the desert  to find my purpose at a poetry reading, revealing injustices and lost identities boiled down in this melting pot and listen  as though in the truth  of another, some answer may be found, but in an instant am shattered when a note scrawled on napkin is passed to me, "This is not Starbuck's," a message for skin white like mine.
1122-I come to the desert  to find my homeland  for I am removed  three generations from my name.
1123-Perhaps it would be better to find my past in the Polish family who came to this United States to escape their torturers and build generations who could speak the language, who would not have to break backs  and cramp fingers in the tobacco fields, picking and sweating and laying leaves across wood to dry.
1124-I am told these were my people, strangers to me, I was carried away to the desert when I was three.
1125-I was not told their stories until the summer Stasia took me to Chu Chu's to hear her memories of being in the Catholic concentration camp with her son Billy.
1126-It was seven years  before they escaped, after the war was over,  but before liberation came.
1127-I come to the desert because these stories do not truly belong to me, and I cannot find comfort in Chu Chu's words at the end of her tale, "the Jews deserved it," her ancient face revealing eyes still unforgiving, betraying her frailty.
1128-She was dead four years before I was told.
1129-So I come to the desert, seeking community and culture only tasted at restaurants, licking my lips, the color on my body and deny my race, for I am not white, I am beige, beige like these desert sands, beige like these hard rock mountains.
1130-I am beige in the sun.
1131-I darken my skin in the shadows.
1132-I stand alone, the last of my family line, the family who worked to give me the freedom  to buy a new history for myself among the madness of conquerors  enslavers liars murderers skin white  like the blisters  on my beige  heels, as I walk the desert to find  the sacred space to heal  my common humanity.
1133-SOMEPLACE NEW AGAIN   I have had it with trolling for visions.
1134-The fish never bite and  I feel kind of funny pulling them up from the depths, considering the bends and all.
1135-Though flashy colors and neon  have always caught my fancy, I realize there is more to pretty than that which remains when eyes  are closed.
1136-Life is everywhere and I am.
1137-Life is a kaleidoscope and I am up late feeling  the magic of dreams cast by my neighbors, and happiness  is found in simply being happy.
1138-After all,  freedom isn't about freeing everyone else.
1139-Let everyone find his own cloud monsters and  try to break them up with the power of his will alone.
1140-Let everybody find her own set of flannel sheets to sleep comfortably at night.
1141-We ride our bikes on parallel paths and I am  no more than just a few inches from you.
1142-We climb our mountains with the same  weight of gravity tugging at our boots and I have no idea if this rope will hold.
1143-The end result is never really an ending, but begin here just in case you think you have arrived someplace new again.
1144-FROM FLAMES   If there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you.
1145-I have reached to the stars, I have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them.
1146-I dusted them off  and shined them up, as though God cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while.
1147-What's not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step  to emerge from the abyss or  their leg to twitch  towards liberation.
1148-I followed that map to oblivion time and time again  until I realized it was only  a representation.
1149-I gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the Self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness.
1150-Still the songs played on like trickling fingertips  on skin, light and playful and  wanting.
1151-Still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness  of love regardless  of regard.
1152-And night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or  time to arise from these flames like the Phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can.
1153-Flap, flap, flap.
1154-A STEP CLOSER TO STEPPING OFF   Voices raised like hands above heads, like waves  of fingers piano playing the air, accidental harmonies wanting  an end or just wanting  more.
1155-The world spins out of synch, faster and hotter, like water spills like steam rises, like warm mud  or the soft underbellies of earth worms, making their way home while everybody goes about his business.
1156-Drums beat to  mark the passage; the young girls dance while the boys look on, ying and yang pushed to a crescendo, cutting through the cage, as if victory is nothing more  than  a barrier breached again  and again.
1157-For whose benefit are these metaphors and significances and coincidences?
1158-For whose reward are these smiles and knowing winks and a nudge and a nudge and a nudge?
1159-Wrong, wrong, wrong but will  we know right  when we see it?
1160-Bad, bad, bad but will we know good when we see it?
1161-The opposites define themselves into each other, merging and melting into the mud, and the earthworms go about their business, while everybody makes her way home.
1162-The shouting turns to singing, turns to whispers, turns to laughter, turns to silence and then a rest between notes.
1163-GERMINATION   The flowers you gave me are beginning  to open on my window sill; red rose taking on a new shape as the day progresses, overpowering the black-eyed susans.
1164-As a gift to Spot, I bring the vase out to the patio where he sprawls  in catlike bliss on the current dining room table.
1165-Stretching out, he purrs, rubbing his face into the leaves, losing his balance in wonder over the smells, and the leaves, and the tiny yellow petals reaching out from their branches  until a lizard catches his eye and it's just me here, remembering the bouquet held in your hands the night before  last.
1166-RIGHT NOW   letting it all come and go and flow without regard to time or spaces between us and  even words and even dreams and even and even  gentle strength  learning not to direct the waves but to sink soar rise the crest and soft back into petals  those times when you are not and those times when you are  the right balance towards upwards the middle path and back down casting no rings on the water 
    emergence and separation   In no time at all and all time, the words from fingertips are creeping to the surface.
1167-Cross the bridge, open the gate;  and it's all countless tribes of butterflies and  the passing  from moon, to sun, to moon, to sun, only clouds can deny the eye.
1168-TOO LATE   Not writing has become a metaphor for my life; instead of finished work behind me, ahead lies scraps of started interrupted thoughts, leading to what is unknown at present;  and I am behind myself, watching like talons underfoot tickle gashes, moving still under currents, thoughtless, running from something, giving up the dream again all too soon, again all too late to never finish the painting or poem.
1169-What half am I trying so hard to whole with;  complete my self, male, female, animal;  and  planets spin and align, and astrologers interpret for the apathetic masses.
1170-I shined too bright to be believable and when daybreak crashed against the bedroom wall, I was too hungry for the comfort and warmth of eyes and arms and legs to wrap around to tell the truth to even myself;  finding out too late, just as good as never finding out at all.
1171-UNWRAPPED   Yesterday afternoon, we weeded  our first garden and  tilled the soil.
1172-Now each  breath we take  is a greater symbol  than jumping  from a plane.
1173-Your fingers touch mine and  the perfect fit of the palms together are more  than two breaths finding rhythm.
1174-Each day more is unwrapped and contents  spill from morning, to afternoon, to evening.
1175-I am below and above and beside it all, looking forward as if  it's the first time that direction  ever existed for me at all.
1176-Cloud  Space   During the time when you have not  yet been to life or death;  everything everyone told you was important;  still  is.
1177-Dreams are something to interpret to find your inner questions.
1178-All purposes must have a goal at the end to cross and the sooner, the better.
1179-You have not yet seen the bricks.
1180-Cloud space on blue sky that should be white.
1181-What is clear but the absence of something blocking.
1182-Less to edit endlessly in the head and  the players still seeming to act from a different script.
1183-Before the veil is lifted, before it is too indescribably beautiful to believe, innocent as the smooth skin on the side of a blade of grass, and you might even forget sometimes to look at the sunset or to remember when the moon will next be full.
1184-Easier  to love in another while simply passing through the absence of clouds.
1185-reflecting the sun   In what ways does life change; thoughts going through and out alongside 64 violins the night the spiritual leader of Palestine was assassinated, just holding  your hand;  to go forward with a dream lived now,  in even the journey north  together;  just to see your face in the morning,  again and again;  and warm skin touching somewhere before sleeping positions are established.
1186-So many stories still untold and  a language left to learn and experiences to share;  while the Aries moon scatters her seeds into  the earth;  rises, wispy outline but still there  reflecting the sun.
1187-BACK FROM NOWHERE   For weeks the wind has been howling backwards, blowing not a leaf but the sound and  the rumble inside is like a passing train.
1188-The whistle never blows here in this town too far from major arteries; still there are tracks to cross back and forth and  harder  on a bike.
1189-And this is home now.
1190-I keep reminding myself how happy I am to have so much shade again.
1191-I keep reminding myself how lucky I am  to have found someone who will live with me and my faults, little lines that open up the earth with a crack to fill with water.
1192-And I keep reminding myself that it's okay to live without forever, it was only a word anyway.
1193-Nights like these, the distant traffic sounds from Waldo Road are as comforting  as any waves reaching the shore but I still strain to hear a few planes or the helicopter landing on Broward General or searching for crime.
1194-It's small town life and my space  is smaller too.
1195-I'm still learning to share.
1196-It's so much easier for me to give.
1197-You are asleep now, resting for work and dreams I do not understand.
1198-Sometimes I wonder  if we weren't closer apart.
1199-TWITCH   Blepharospasm is another way of saying an eye twitch; different than a blink or a wink; unexpected now and utterly unwanted.
1200-They say it's stress related but I don't want to look inside anymore for answers.
1201-Haven't I opened that door, let in wind through that window, and buried myself whole in a hole where the rain came... but it didn't even work last time anyway and how am I supposed to get health insurance with a record like this playing on...skip...skip.
1202-record scratches on the harmonica solo   Grieving myself into I box, I saw the sun through narrow slits, and clouds forming and the voices of all the arms around me drawing near, too near.
1203-Each is in her own stage of dying down the mattered ways of age and giving up something for lent.
1204-A thousand opportunities to grow and close and dance alone as one,  the dust rising from the road below his feet,  as thunder invites the rain forward in time.
1205-Beasts and burdens, the bud opening again and again rather than giving up the flower pot.
1206-A daisy in your hair or a paper airplane and still these questions slam dunk, rock the surface of the walls until the paint peels off like wallpaper and  someone is still not here.
1207-No fortune left to chance as the craving of the ring moves like shadows on the movie theater wall, tickles the projectionist for a moment, then moves on.
1208-And we are not the wind.
1209-And we are not the sail.
1210-And we are not the ship, the bow, the galley.
1211-And we are not the passing hour, the memory of yesterday's tomorrow.
1212-muddled through, hands still clenching like a baby's fist.
1213-Knowing who you are is all the more reason to fight the form, only half of what could be if letting go were that easy.
1214-Merge me into your flesh and give me a reason to stay in the now longer than a blink.
1215-Welcome me home, distracting the ending one more time.
1216-wonka's soliloquy on the wonkatania    there's no earthly way of knowing  which direction we are going  there's no knowing where we're rowing  or which way the river's flowing  is it raining  is it snowing  is a hurricane a-blowing  bleh!
1217-not a speck of light is showing  so the danger must be growing  are the fires of hell a glowing?
1218-is the grisly reaper mowing?
1219-yes!
1220-the danger must be growing  for the rowers keep on rowing  and they're certainly not showing  any signs that they are slowing!
1221-we're there

1481-Gemini - Full Moon Meditation   from  urlLink The Labours of Hercules    I recognize my other self and while this fades I grow and glow. (May 21 - June 20)  This full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of Hercules from the Greek myth.
1482-The twelve tasks of Hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the Heart of God.
1483-As mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal.
1484-So we travel "on the path until we become that path", from Aries to Taurus and Gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to Pisces.
1485-In Gemini active work sets the standard tone.
1486-First comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in Aries and overcome desire in Taurus - the light of God everywhere.
1487-In the third sign of the astrological year, Gemini, the Twins, Hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: Go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the Hesperides.
1488-Unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed.
1489-Perseverance holds the key.
1490-The task appears to be easy and Hercules hurries into it.
1491-But the garden of the Hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins.
1492-Throughout the land Hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success.
1493-He is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way.
1494-From North he turns to South and wrestles with Antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness.
1495-Antaeus overcomes him at every point until Hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground.
1496-To the West Hercules now turns with new courage.
1497-He meets Busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone.
1498-Hercules loves and adores Busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year.
1499-Finally Hercules turns inwards and realises that "Truth lies within yourself".
1500-So he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before.
1501-A pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of Hercules, the one of Prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him.
1502-Hercules breaks the binding chain, frees Prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds.
1503-With much loss of time Hercules turns to the high mountains of the East, meeting Atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back.
1504-Hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain.
1505-He forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay.

1720-urlLink SCORPIO LUNAR CYCLE  by Crystal Pomeroy Oct. 25 - Nov. 22 This Scorpio New Moon begins the lunar cycle marked by Samhain, Halloween (originally, Hallows Mass), El Da de los Muertos, and All Souls' Daythe classic Scorpio festivities around the world.
1721-Prayerful reflection sets this lunation and the intense energies it entails off to a high-vibration start.
1722-It also gives us a chance to move into the years end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong Saturn influences.
1723-According to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of lifes most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated.
1724-The current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, Earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to  tap into transpersonal forces .
1725-According to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank Spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit.
1726-From these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest.
1727-On special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by Wikkans and Central Americans of native descent).
1728-At its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (Mother Earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear.
1729-The race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the Samhain New Moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to  multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a Samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding:  strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing years goals .
1730-Stay tuned to our meditation for the Full Moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our years work, as we will also share a magical Full Moon offering to heal Mother Earth.
1731-Before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, lets reflect on what this particular Samhain New Moon has to do with tolerance.

2190-urlLink Researchers have begun to explain how emotional reactions and logical thinking interact in moral decision-making  Princeton University researchers reported in the Sept. 14 issue of Science that they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze brain activity in people who were asked to ponder a range of moral dilemmas.
2191-The results suggest that, while people regularly reach the same conclusions when faced with uncomfortable moral choices, their answers often do not grow out of the reasoned application of general moral principles.
2192-Instead, they draw on emotional reactions, particularly for certain kinds of moral dilemmas.
2193-The results also show how tools of neuroscience are beginning to reveal the biological underpinnings of the subtlest elements of human behavior, said Joshua Greene, a graduate student in philosophy who conducted the study in collaboration with scientists in the psychology department and the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior.
2194-"We think of moral judgments as so ethereal," said Greene.
2195-"Now we're in a position to start looking at brain anatomy and understanding how neural mechanisms produce patterns in our behavior."

         Bees invade the internet   By BBC News Online internet reporter Mark Ward  Soon software that acts like bees or ants could be running the internet.
2293-Researchers at the University of California are claiming that we need radically new ways to run the net as more and more people and devices go online.
2294-Michael Wang and Tatsuya Suda say that existing methods of keeping the net going will not be able to cope when billions of people, mobile phones, hand-held computers and household appliances are routinely using it to communicate.
2295-What is needed, claim the pair, are self-organising systems inspired by biology.
2296-The researchers are experimenting with discrete programs called agents that have been modelled on bees and ants.
2297-Individually these insects are very stupid but put enough of them together and they do a very efficient job of running and maintaining huge structures like nests and hives without any central control.
2298-By contrast, current internet management systems tend to be very centralised and directed by people.
2299-Mr Wang says that this set-up will be unable to cope when everything from our PCs to refrigerators is online.
2300-No-one will have the time or inclination to ensure that all the devices are doing what they should, he says.
2301-"The devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things," says Mr Wang.
2302-Many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them.
2303-When Sir Paul McCartney did a webcast of a performance at the Cavern in Liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show.
2304-Under the scheme proposed by the US researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it.
2305-Mr Wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source.
2306-The bees "die" when users stop requesting clips.
2307-Belgian scientist Marco Dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet.
2308-But he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people.
2309-The bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do.
2310-This rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the Lord of the Rings movie currently being filmed in New Zealand.
2311-The troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed.
2312-Battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action.

2318-Tolkien and his keen readers are often criticised for being stuck in eternal adolescence, and labelled as geeks.
2319-I'd like to take a closer look at these labels.
2320-Consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they're want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals.
2321-Many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one's 'inner child.'
2322-The inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world.
2323-Well and good; evidently the "inner child" is regarded as good and precious.
2324-But what can we say about the inner adolescent?
2325-Why aren't we nurturing the inner adolescent?
2326-I think you can hardly say the phrase 'teenager' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one's own years of irritable awkwardness.
2327-We haven't got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should.
2328-The author Philip Pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers.
2329-At that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: What is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose?
2330-Later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared.
2331-I'd agree with that.
2332-I'd go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world's tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... Teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly.
2333-As one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest.
2334-I think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils.
2335-I'd like to throw in one of the ultimate Romantic poems I've ever come across.
2336-It's by an Argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture:   For Afterwards  I would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight.
2337-And in the final instants I would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall.
2338-To die when life is sadly hauling back  its golden nets from out the tide's deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that's lost from sight.
2339-To die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: I am yours although we know so well it will betray us.
2340-Manuel Gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (Translation: Gordon Challis)  Yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose.
2341-It is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life.
2342-It offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world.
2343-It may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness.
2344-But would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness?
2345-I could not bear the loss.
2346-For this is the inner teenager that Tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to.
2347-They are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds.
2348-Nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans.
2349-Sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too.
2350-Because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not.
2351-The whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too.
2352-Other people are involved in writing more about this, but I'll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts.
2353-Firstly, what is a geek?
2354-Articles like Julian Dibbell's 'Lord of the Geeks' article on Village Voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they're some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world.
2355-They're losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media.
2356-(And I might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.)
2357-My own definition of geeks is this: A geek cares about a subject or system so much that they're willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not.
2358-The link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they're absorbed in play.
2359-It's only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there's some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising.
2360-Instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they'd rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the Plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin.
2361-Sometimes they're fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they've found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they'll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks.
2362-The larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame.
2363-In their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else.
2364-Geeks resist that because, well, it'd mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity.
2365-There's always been geeks.
2366-Mozart?
2367-What a nerd!

       Japan Scientists Grow Artificial Eyeball -Kyodo TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese scientists have succeeded in growing artificial eyeballs for the first time in the world, Kyodo news agency said Saturday.
2376-A group of researchers led by Makoto Asashima, biology professor at Tokyo University, succeeded in growing eyeballs in tadpoles using cells taken from frog embryos, Kyodo said.
2377-``Since the basics of body-making is common to that of human beings, I think this might help enable people to regain vision in the future,'' Asashima was quoted as saying.
2378-The group, after soaking undifferentiated cells from the embryo of a Platanna frog in a special medium, transplanted the eyeball into a tadpole whose left eye had been removed before it was hatched, Kyodo said.
2379-A week after the transplant, Asashima's group confirmed the tadpole's eyeball was connected to the optic nerves and there were no rejection symptoms, it said.

        urlLink ENFP under stress  ENFP  ENFPs have a tendency to overextend themselves in both their physical and emotional commitments.
2420-Their proclivity to procrastinate and to overlook details complicates their circumstances.
2421-ENFPs often move on to new ventures without completing those they have already started.
2422-Their charming personalities can show signs of irritability and over-sensitivity when their desires to please different people come into conflict.
2423-During times of stress, ENFPs feel alienated.
2424-They then engage in deceptions that serve to obscure what is occurring within themselves.
2425-The ENFP finds symbolic meanings behind the immediate circumstances.
2426-These meanings are construed as foreboding problems when ENFPs are under stress.
2427-Having a pervasive feeling of losing control over their own independent identities, ENFPs will feel virtually split apart by intruding circumstances.
2428-They will be "besides themselves" and "just not all there"  as if something, or someone, has taken away the essence of who they are.
2429-Not feeling like themselves, the ENFP will become subject to their own feelings of shame for being a phony, a fake or an impostor.
2430-If stress continues to grow, they may attribute malevolent schemes to others in order to explain away their fears.
2431-urlLink Conflicting relations   These are relations of constantly developing conflict.
2432-Conflicting relations have the worst compatibility between partners among all other relations.
2433-However, it does not seem to be so obvious, especially in the earlier stages of development.
2434-Conflicting partners appear rather attractive, interesting and with impressive abilities.
2435-Both partners are usually convinced that they can coexist and collaborate quite peacefully, but soon it becomes apparent that something is always going wrong, making their relationship problematic.
2436-Both partners may mistakenly think that the cause of these problems is minor and easily fixed and that all they need to do is to show a little bit more effort in understanding their partner.
2437-Unfortunately, these attempts to continue pushing their relationship any further will soon provoke an open conflict between the partners.
2438-When conflict starts, partners hit each other with arguments exactly in the direction where they can cause maximum pain.
2439-In return, the other partner may counterattack even more aggressively.
2440-With every conflict these relations become worse and worse.
2441-Although Conflicting partners show confidence where their partner is unconfident, they are unable to protect and take care of each other's weak points.
2442-This regularly brings disagreement and disappointment into these relations.
2443-When after several fruitless attempts to establish a stable relationship the partners give up and break the relationship, they feel saved and released.

2445-One of the Ohio-based company's t-shirts reads "Wong Brothers Laundry Service -- Two Wongs Can Make It White" and shows two smiling men with slanted eyes wearing conical hats.
2446-Abercrombie said the shirts were supposed to be funny and cater to Asian customers.
2447-"We personally thought Asians would love this T-shirt," said Hampton Carney, a spokesman for the company.
2448-The T-shirts prompted a late-night meeting of Stanford University students Wednesday.
2449-The Asian American Students' Association encouraged calls to the company, and said Abercrombie  Fitch should apologize.
2450-"It's really misleading as to what Asian people are," said Michael Chang, vice chairman of the student organization.
2451-"The stereotypes they depict are more than a century old.

        urlLink SELF-HELP: Divorce  DIVORCE: A Crisis, Any Way You Look At It   If you are currently facing the realities of a divorce--either as a partner in a failing marriage, or as a child of parents whose marriage is ending--you are not alone.
2490-More than two and one-half million adults divorce every year; and more than a million children become children of divorced parents.
2491-Divorce is a CRISIS of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes.
2492-According to the dictionary, a "crisis" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur.
2493-That is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so.
2494-In fact, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning DANGER and OPPORTUNITY.
2495-The process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities.
2496-The dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--LOSS.
2497-Whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce.
2498-Recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses.
2499-It is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma.
2500-Reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror.
2501-In these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it.
2502-A later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning.
2503-Feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression.
2504-Again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate.
2505-It is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities.
2506-The dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense.
2507-For children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it.
2508-This loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster.
2509-Furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings.
2510-Thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss.
2511-To help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect.
2512-They need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs.
2513-They need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage.
2514-They need structure and routine and consistency.
2515-Finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling.
2516-And they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings.
2517-As stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity.
2518-Once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce.
2519-The crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings.
2520-it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment.
2521-At this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience.
2522-Through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life.
2523-For many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis.
2524-For most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous.
2525-There are many books available to assist you in these challenges.
2526-Two useful ones are Divorcing by Kranzler and Belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and How to Survive the Loss of a Love by Colgrove, Bloomfiled and McWilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general).
2527-Also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce.
2528-Consult with the Counseling Center in Shoemaker Hall (314-7651) or the Mental Health Clinic in the Health Center (314-8106).
2529-They offer support and help.

        urlLink   THE FOUR EMOTIONAL STAGES OF DIVORCE WORK by Phil Rich, Ed.D., MSW.
2540-The End of Marriage   The hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence.
2541-Accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting.
2542-Divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners.
2543-Regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss.
2544-Divorce is composed of both "technical" and "emotional" aspects.
2545-The technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process.
2546-But the "other" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath.
2547-This is "divorce work" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce.
2548-The Emotional Stages of Divorce  Although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they're not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time.
2549-At this difficult time, it can help to understand what's typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they're likely to experience, and in what order.
2550-These are the "emotional" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through.
2551-The necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include:  facing the reality of the divorce  working through painful feelings  experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage  coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss  adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life    Stage 1:  "Shock and Disbelief" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in.
2552-It involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through.
2553-Facing reality  Self esteem and inadequacy  Telling the world  Support and help    Stage 2:  "Initial Adjustment" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives.
2554-The primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include:  Functioning and responsibility  Practical reality  Legal Matters  Managing emotions    Stage 3:  "Active Re-organization" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single.
2555-Major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include:  Managing life style and practical affairs  Re-defining relationships  Reconstructing personal values and beliefs  Concluding legal procedures    Stage 4:  "Life Re-formation" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the "other" side of their divorce.
2556-During this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives.
2557-Constructing relationships  New interests  Personal responsibility  Accepting your new life    Summary and Conclusion  The first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly.
2558-It's the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over.
2559-The second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce.
2560-The final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life.
2561-This stage really has no formal "end," and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional.
2562-Of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap.
2563-And things aren't as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next.
2564-But helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them.

        urlLink   Question: You've discussed briefly some of the physiological and emotional differences between the sexes.
2602-Could you list other physical characteristics unique to males and females?
2603-Dr. Dobson Responds:  Men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren't even conscious of.
2604-Here are just a few of those differences:   1.
2605-A woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern.
2606-Normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the U.S.
2607-Females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus.
2608-More than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.159   2.
2609-Men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.160   3.
2610-Men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.161   4.
2611-The sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk.
2612-The first finger of a woman's hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true.
2613-Boys' teeth last longer than do those of girls.162   5.
2614-Women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.163   6.
2615-Women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation.
2616-Each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly.
2617-Female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied.
2618-The glands work differently in the two sexes.
2619-For example, a woman's thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty.
2620-Women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.164   7.
2621-Women's blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells).
2622-Since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint.
2623-Her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter.
2624-When the working day in British factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.165   8.
2625-Men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.166   9.
2626-Women's hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute).
2627-Their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.167   10.
2628-Female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.168   11.
2629-Women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.169   12.
2630-Men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern.
2631-The implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle.
2632-For example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways.
2633-The young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top.
2634-Women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170   Who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness?

2692-There is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior.
2693-Yes, people are different.
2694-Let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me.
2695-I am not saying that everybody is equal.
2696-Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either.
2697-People are simply unique, incomparable.
2698-You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life, you have to contribute your potential to life.
2699-I have to discover my own being, you have to discover your own being.
2700-When inferiority disappears, all feeling of superiority also disappears.
2701-They live together, they cannot be separated.
2702-The man who feels superior is still feeling inferior somewhere.
2703-The man who feels inferior wants to feel superior somewhere.
2704-They come in a pair; they are always there together; they cannot be separated.
2705-It happened... A very proud man, a warrior, a samurai, came to see a Zen master.
2706-The samurai was very famous, well known all over the country, But looking at the master, looking at the beauty of the master and the grace of the moment, he suddenly felt inferior.
2707-Maybe he had come with an unconscious desire to prove his superiority.
2708-He said to the master "Why am I feeling inferior?
2709-Just a moment ago, everything was okay.
2710-As I entered into your court suddenly I felt inferior.
2711-I have never felt like that.
2712-My hands are shaking.
2713-I am a warrior, I have faced death many times, and I have never felt any fear--why am I feeling frightened?"
2714-The master said, "You wait.
2715-When everybody has gone, I will answer."
2716-People continued coming to visit the master, and the man was getting tired, more and more tired.
2717-By the evening the room was empty, there was nobody, and the samurai said, "Now, can you answer it?"
2718-And the master said, "Now, come outside."
2719-A full moon night--the moon was just rising on the horizon... And he said, "Look at these trees, this tree high in the sky and this small tree.
2720-They both have existed by the side of my window for years, and there has never been any problem.
2721-The smaller tree has never said, 'Why do I feel inferior before you?'
2722-to the big tree.
2723-How is it possible?
2724-This tree is small, and that tree is big, and I have never heard any whisper."
2725-The samurai said, "Because they can't compare."
2726-The master said, "Then you need not ask me; you know the answer."
2727-Comparison brings inferiority, superiority.
2728-When you don't compare, all inferiority, all superiority, disappear.
2729-Then you are, you are simply there.
2730-A small bush or a big high tree--it doesn't matter; you are yourself.
2731-You are needed.
2732-A grass leaf is needed as much as the biggest star.
2733-Without the grass leaf God will be less than he is.
2734-The sound of the cuckoo is needed as much as any Buddha; the world will be less, will be less rich if the cuckoo disappears.
2735-Just look around.
2736-All is needed, and everything fits together.

2745-urlLink Haiku For Beginners    I guess the first thing you noticed is that they're short - two or three lines only.
2746-There are not many words in those lines either.
2747-And you didn't hear rhymes, did you?
2748-Beyond their physical form, these poems obviously have something else in common.
2749-It is something to do with the subject matter and the direct method of presentation.
2750-If we had time to discuss it we could refine that thought until we had something like this.
2751-The poems speak  - about experience from the senses  - directly and with intensity  - about observation of nature   They seek to construct a clear and significant image in our minds or perhaps to juxtapose or contrast two such images.
2752-Usually it is an image from nature or from daily life.
2753-Perhaps though, to say that the poem 'constructs' the image in our mind is a bad way of saying it.
2754-Really the poem is reminding us of something we've already seen, heard or felt.
2755-That's how they manage to conjure up so complex an image with so few words.
2756-One possibility is to go with what you know now.
2757-Let me first remind you of the rules I've already given you.
2758-The poem should be start with an image or a pair if them.
2759-It should be direct from sense experience, without metaphor, simile or rhyme.
2760-Haiku is of course a traditional Japanese form with further strict rules of construction.
2761-Not all are honoured outside Japan and even there some are defiantly broken.
2762-To what I've already stated let me add three more stipulations.
2763-three lines with 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5  one kigo or season word  one kireji or cutting word   The first rule is the most well known and it is the one most mentioned by writers on the subject of haiku.
2764-The idea is simple.
2765-Write a line of five syllables, follow it with a seven-syllable line and then use five syllables to make the final line.
2766-This gives you two short lines divided by a longer one.
2767-It goes a long way to guiding the method of expression in the poem.
2768-There is a good deal of controversy about this rule; but let's skip that for the moment and talk about the third.
2769-The kireji or cutting word is used to divide the haiku into two parts.
2770-Obviously this should be used to enhance the juxtaposition of images we discussed earlier.
2771-In English the tendency is to use punctuation, such as "-" or ":" to perform this function.
2772-The second rule that requires the use of a kigo or season word helps establish the season or time of year that the poem describes.
2773-For English-language haiku this rule is taken to remind the writer that the poem should be grounded in nature.
2774-But most important is that the form isn't the goal here.
2775-It's to write a good poem.
2776-So the exercise of writing haiku oneself is very important.
2777-Occasional reading and discussion on the form, tradition and history of haiku and reading others' haiku all help to feed the writing with new ideas and approaches.

2870-urlLink Robert E. Wilkinson 's The Quantum Brahman   In their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world's leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe.
2871-Scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact.
2872-The first of these categories is the Gravitational Force.
2873-It is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force.
2874-The gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the Sun, Moon and Planets.
2875-The second category is the Electromagnetic Force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles.
2876-While it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another.
2877-The third category called the Weak Nuclear Force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos.
2878-In 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism.
2879-It is now called the Electro-weak force.
2880-The fourth category, called the Strong Nuclear Force, binds particles together into combinations.
2881-Matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks.
2882-The strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.
2883-While these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe.
2884-This problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification.
2885-Their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the Luminiferous Ether.
2886-It was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances.
2887-To the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions.
2888-But, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the Etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field.
2889-Leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation.
2890-Since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the Quantum Vacuum.
2891-However, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the Quantum Vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe.
2892-Scientists now agree that it was the Quantum Vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe.
2893-And they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum.
2894-A number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a Grand Unified Field Formula.
2895-The discovery of the Quantum Vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon.
2896-Physicists cautiously agree that the Quantum Vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter.
2897-There is even a growing consensus among scientists that Vacuum Physics lie at the core of everything.
2898-But, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the Quantum Vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go.
2899-They have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable.
2900-The laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density.
2901-In order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the Quantum Vacuum and measure the density of the Transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of Time.
2902-For Time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter.
2903-For centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that Time was a derivative of Space even to the point of calling it 'Space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; Time is what gives birth to Space.
2904-In his commentaries on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of India's oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, Sri Aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle:   " ...
2905-The [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed.
2906-(Time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.)
2907-From the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal.
2908-Time in its period is the Self of the Horse Sacrificial, so not Matter but Time, is the body of this force of the material universe... Space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of Time which the sage attributes to his Horse of the worlds, by movement in Space its periods are shaped and determined.
2909-Hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the Horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of Space, but the magnitudes of Time... for Time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in Space possible."
2910-Sri Aurobindo, The Upanishads; 'The Great Aranyaka', Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, 1971  In the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest.
2911-They may exist in Being but not in Time.
2912-They are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of Time.
2913-For it is Saturn/Chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the Supreme Godhead into material form.
2914-In its native state, the Absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; One without a second.
2915-In order for the Incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible.
2916-It does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms.
2917-It manifests first as Cosmic and Planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain.
2918-Through this alchemical process, the Absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated Unity into Form and Multiplicity.
2919-This act of contraction, is the basis upon which the Greek myths portray Saturn/Chronos as having dismembered his father.
2920-In order to break the code of the Transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy.
2921-It must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach.
2922-Scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality.
2923-Fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because Cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order.
2924-One of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, David Bohm in his book, Wholeness and the Implicate Order.
2925-Using the language of mathematics, Bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the Explicate Order.
2926-"The Explicate Order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the Implicate order.
2927-It is the precursor of the Explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object.
2928-The Implicate order implies within it all physical universes.
2929-However, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential.
2930-It is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order.
2931-Bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence.
2932-The creative process springs from this realm.
2933-Energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order."
2934-Will Keepin, David Bohm, Noetic Science Journal  When Bohm's resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality.
2935-The Zero Point Order which Bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of Indian metaphysics known as the Brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as Absolute Being.
2936-Realization of the Brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of Time and Consciousness which we experience as Timelessness, or undifferentiated Time.
2937-In this state Time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness.
2938-Hence it cannot produce any form or any division of Consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in Space.
2939-In the language of physics the Brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as Emptiness or a Void.
2940-It appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases.
2941-The amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line.
2942-In this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said.
2943-Bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power.
2944-His calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this Zero Point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe.
2945-Bohm's work with Zero Point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the Absolute or Brahman becomes manifest in Time and Space.
2946-And while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like Sri Aurobindo, Bohm's discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits Emptiness or a Void as the highest spiritual realization.
2947-"Nothing can arise from Nothing.
2948-Asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, "Here there is nothing."
2949-Out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero.
2950-But what in truth is this zero?
2951-It is an incalculable Infinite... Our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness.
2952-In truth there is nothing but Light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision's limited range."
2953-Sri Aurobindo, The Web of Yoga, Centenary Edition, Vol.
2954-17, p. 48  Bohm's breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish Fullness rather than a Void as the ground state of the universe.
2955-The implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of Spirit and Matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter.
2956-While these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of Vedic India.
2957-Long ago the Rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the Etheric Plenum, or Fullness from which all things emerge.
2958-According to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that Etheric Plenum.
2959-The Atharva Veda describes that point or seed as an 'Embryo [Hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.'
2960-This embryo or seed lies at the intersection of Time and Space, Spirit and Matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution.
2961-In the language of scientific cosmology, this point or Seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being.
2962-In metaphysical terms it is the Luminiferous Ether, the OM or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin.
2963-All material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time.
2964-Once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the Seer to follow the evolving in our Time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction.
2965-Knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the Vedic Rishis because It allowed them to follow the unfolding of that Seed and 'See' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality.
2966-They were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the Transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line.
2967-This knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the Rig Veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over.
2968-The Seer became displaced by the Nirvani as emphasis shifted from Gnosis to a philosophy of Illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a Transcendent consciousness.
2969-As a result of this development, the bridge between the Transcendent and the Physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant.
2970-It was understood that the Brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the All was once again a great mystery.
2971-"When the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence.
2972-More importantly, that essence itself became deformed.
2973-The experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth.
2974-This was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on Earth.
2975-Above all, creation became divested of true sacredness."
2976-Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The Vishaal Newsletter, October, 1988  Today, some two thousand years later, Science and Spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that Truth or Salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or Nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit.
2977-The influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven Science and Spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence.
2978-The key to that paradigm is a new understanding of Time and its primary role bridging the Transcendent and the Physical world.
2979-"It cannot be denied that Time is a major feature of our material universe.
2980-In consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, Time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go 'beyond time', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate Time.
2981-Conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of Time.
2982-Furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which Time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation."
2983-Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The New Way, Vol.
2984-3, 1983  In the early 1970's Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, the world's leading authority on Vedic Cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries.
2985-She had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient India evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture.
2986-The Rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends.
2987-Their knowledge of Time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient Yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as Truth-Consciousness or Swar of the Veda.
2988-The Rishis understood that the Cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form.
2989-They also knew that the difference between man/woman and the Cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the Macrocosm and Microcosm had a correspondent equivalence.
2990-Through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the Cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world.
2991-Since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the Macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life.
2992-If man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of Cosmic Time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience.
2993-Since the same Zero Womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this Soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of Truth-Consciousness or Gnosis.
2994-This was the essence of the Rig Vedic Yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970's by Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet.
2995-From the principles of these ancient teachings, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, The Gnostic Circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos.
2996-"The Gnostic Circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system.
2997-The Circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the Circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of Earth life.
2998-The joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the Spirit.
2999-In fact we can say that the Gnostic Circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind."
3000-Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet ,The Gnostic Circle, p. 159, 1975  Ms. Norelli-Bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of Time and Measure.
3001-Her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of Time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of Time as the integrative mechanism by which a Divine purpose is expressed in the world.
3002-Her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material Reality which include the Being as well as the dynamics of the Becoming of that same Being.
3003-"Time", says Norelli-Bachelet, "is the vehicle, the medium for the Absolute or Supreme Consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the Spiritual and Physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the Supreme within the physical manifestation ."
3004-In Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's Cosmology, the Zero Womb or what science is now calling the Quantum Vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the Sun or primary Axis of our own Universe.
3005-The nine planets which orbit about the Sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that Zero/Womb/Axis.
3006-The planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called Cabalistic Reduction.
3007-Since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of Number and relate the movement of the spheres to the Calendar which measures time periods on earth.
3008-Through this system of cosmic harmonies, the Gnostic Circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between Time and Space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms.
3009-By unveiling the Quantum Brahman or body of the Absolute, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the Zero Womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form.
3010-She has rebuilt the bridge between Spirit and Matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order.
3011-Through the use of her Gnostic Circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that Implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the Explicate universe.
3012-Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality.

        urlLink No-Shame, No-Blame Creation Story   by Clare Puskarczyk   In the beginning...  there was an entity of light  within a lovely garden  which was also made of light.
3015-A single being, with many aspects  living in peace and harmony.
3016-When a serpent,  who knew well of matter said,  "Birth, Death, Rebirth."
3017-The quality of the light being  that would become known  as the feminine said,  "Why Not?
3018-Exploration, process."
3019-The masculine energy said,  "Structure, power."
3020-And the serpent said,  Be aware, you may forget  who and what you really are."
3021-She said, "We'll remember."
3022-And she said to the masculine energy,  "I'll remind you of our light."
3023-And he agreed,  and so they split in two,  into two separate beings,  and the Universe around them  became a duality, And they forgot.
3024-And everything became heavy and  matter now mattered most of all.
3025-Gravity became grave  in its seriousness  and grave as in death,  and they suffered,  and became ill,  and felt lost  and sometimes,  they almost remembered...  something.
3026-and there were times...  when there was joy and light  but always a longing  to get back out of matter.
3027-back to where?
3028-And so they began to learn  how to use matter  and they thought they were powerful  and so a great battle began.
3029-Everyone wanted to have power  power over matter  power over each other  power over thoughts and feelings  power over structures  especially the masculine beings  because their focus was structure.
3030-And they took things apart  and made more...things.
3031-And often...there was fear,  fear of each other,  fear of thoughts  feelings,  fear of the loss of structure.
3032-Structures became institutions  But the feminine beings  were not preoccupied  with the institutions.
3033-Instead they were occupied  with life,  with nature,  with babies  and a different order of things.
3034-Sometimes...  she would remind him  of something,  but he thought he would  lose his power  if he remembered  and so he remained...forgetful.
3035-And for this... he held power over her,  power over nature,  power over his own natural self,  as in control, repression, structure.
3036-Fear kept these beings time-bound  and distanced them  from their light inside,  and their light remained interior  while they took everything apart.
3037-Discovery pulled them forward  until almost everything  large and small  was in pieces.
3038-what they didn't know was that  the external world was becoming  a reflection of themselves,  fragmented selves  with fragmented thoughts,  conflicts unresolved,  split inside.
3039-And the external world  reflected opposites everywhere as in:  Good people don't kill, but...  we must have  war  weapons  to keep our power.
3040-Good people don't lie, but...  we must deny and deceive  to keep our power.
3041-Good people don't harm, but...  we must argue and abuse  to keep our power.
3042-Yet behind all of this  there was still light,  and there were  those who would remember  something  and living differently  some of them stood out  as heroes...strangely enough.
3043-Finally...  after many thousands of years,  when the world was full of  war and weapons,  denial and deception  and abuse of every kind,  and matter had contracted  as far as it could go,  little sparks of light  began to flash  more  more often  and remembering  began to manifest as:  concern for the environment,  conflict resolution,  love for one another  with integration and wholeness  bringing the fragments  back together.
3044-Now...  individuals were creating community,  scientists discovering quantum leaps,  spiritual psychology learning  and teaching empowerment,  and the lights became brighter still.
3045-Soon there were those  who remembered very well  that power was indeed interior,  that everything was made of light,  that evil meant  to live backwards in fear, and  that trust had  the vibrational quality  to bring light forward.
3046-And that everyone together  had been Making it all up!
3047-Even still...  people seemed to take sides.
3048-And in the end,  those full of light  looked at those full of fear  and saw their light hidden inside  and loved them.
3049-And those full of fear  looked at those full of love  and saw their light  and remembered their own,  and they all remembered together  and began to lighten up.
3050-And soon  they found themselves  at home again... Back in the garden.

3064-I think - therefore I am  You create your world!
3065-No other concept possesses the power that this idea does.
3066-Think about it?
3067-The power to change your world rests within yourself  within your mind!
3068-Thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities.
3069-This physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise.
3070-When you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create.
3071-You make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want.
3072-Remember!
3073-You have a right to create your own world.
3074-That right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers  divine powers, we might add  who cherish that right themselves.
3075-They would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you.
3076-Except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation.
3077-To reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess.
3078-Doing both will take time.
3079-However, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation.
3080-To begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you cant control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control.
3081-Along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness.
3082-Your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality.
3083-Learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process.
3084-Good reality-control comes from within, not without.
3085-An uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal.
3086-This untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires.
3087-All these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation.
3088-Except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast.
3089-When a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beasts world.
3090-This haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid.
3091-Your consciousnesss driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants.
3092-Now, to help make our point, lets take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness.
3093-Does you mind wander regularly  jumping from topic to topic?
3094-In other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items?
3095-Anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering.
3096-Mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast.
3097-Do you continually look on the negative side of things?
3098-A negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness  not you!
3099-Emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating.
3100-However, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over.
3101-Emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within.
3102-Do you often feel mentally drained?
3103-Continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation.
3104-With inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life.
3105-If you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you.
3106-Poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you.
3107-Do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation?
3108-Not knowing how a device operates  especially an inner device  can greatly hinder your ability to use it.
3109-A computer is no good if you havent a clue how to operate it!
3110-Thought-creation is the same.
3111-Your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world.
3112-Otherwise, youll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone.
3113-While the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days.
3114-So, if you dont understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level.
3115-Im sure many of you answered yes to some of these questions.
3116-Answering yes does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned.
3117-Being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources.
3118-Because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity.
3119-You must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others.
3120-With a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life.
3121-For one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you.
3122-You will create the world you want and need.
3123-There will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute.
3124-If you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it.
3125-Your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory.
3126-You will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time.
3127-Plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations.
3128-When an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you.
3129-You will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny.
3130-You create your world!

3219-urlLink People with Moon In Virgo  Does this sound like me?
3220-Moon in Virgo Earth Sign   Emotionally spontaneous is not a phrase to describe a Virgoan Moon personality.
3221-Like their companion in the Earth signs, Taurus, there isnt the headlong rushing into commitments, either.
3222-Virgoan Moons dont overanalyze the relationship as much as they look at the value the relationship may have for themselves.
3223-They may hesitate to move at all unless they feel they are on solid ground, or there is some personal advantage to be gained by their emotional involvement.
3224-As lunar Earth sign personalities, those with Moon in Virgo are guarded about their feelings.
3225-Virgoan Moons dont much care for discussing openly their emotions as if reporting their portfolio.
3226-This is not an ego issue like their neighbor, Leo, as much as it is a ploy to intrigue others to get to know them more intimately.
3227-It isnt easy loving a person with a Virgo Moon because they are over-critical in emotional expressions.
3228-Believe it or not, this Moon sign may actually be unrealistic at times about their own emotions.
3229-Their passion can sometimes be confused with compassion.
3230-An over-critical or too analytical approach to emotional situations makes it difficult for them (as well as the others involved) to freely or spontaneously express feelings.
3231-Serious-minded, with common sense about most things, they can be surprisingly unrealistic.
3232-As a result, they tend to gravitate to situations they know eel rather than explore and be adventuresome with their emotions.
3233-This leads Virgoan Moons too often repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result each time and not getting it.
3234-Virgo Moon personalities are emotionally adaptable.
3235-They instinctively seem to know what it takes to make others feel better.
3236-They make many friends because of their sympathetic nature, but it also means they are vulnerable to being exploited.
3237-Though they are not all scholars, they are likely to be fond of books and writing.
3238-Intellectual curiosity gives them a penchant for gathering information that can develop into serious research endeavors, or turn out to be just a fondness for gossip.
3239-At times they can be overly fastidious, usually with regard to eating habits.
3240-Concern with health makes many of them outstanding health care professionals.
3241-Their own preoccupation with health can become exaggerated to the point of hypochondria, or they can be guilty of using maladies to attract sympathy.
3242-They are mentally and emotionally stimulated by travel, communication, and information.

3245-This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day comes as the U.S. is moving toward war in Iraq.
3246-As media prepare to air retrospectives on King, we thought it would be a good time to circulate this 1995 column by FAIR founder Jeff Cohen and FAIR associate Norman Solomon.
3247------------------- Media Beat, January 4, 1995 The Martin Luther King You Don't See on TV By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon  It's become a TV ritual: Every year in mid-January, around the time of Martin Luther King's birthday, we get perfunctory network news reports about "the slain civil rights leader."
3248-The remarkable thing about this annual review of King's life is that several years-- his last years-- are totally missing, as if flushed down a memory hole.
3249-What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968).
3250-An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968.
3251-Yet King didn't take a sabbatical near the end of his life.
3252-In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever.
3253-Almost all of those speeches were filmed or taped.
3254-But they're not shown today on TV.
3255-Why?
3256-It's because national news media have never come to terms with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for during his final years.
3257-In the early 1960s, when King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South, most major media were his allies.
3258-Network TV and national publications graphically showed the police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods used against Southern blacks who sought the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter.
3259-But after passage of civil rights acts in 1964 and 1965, King began challenging the nation's fundamental priorities.
3260-He maintained that civil rights laws were empty without "human rights"-- including economic rights.
3261-For people too poor to eat at a restaurant or afford a decent home, King said, anti-discrimination laws were hollow.
3262-Noting that a majority of Americans below the poverty line were white, King developed a class perspective.
3263-He decried the huge income gaps between rich and poor, and called for "radical changes in the structure of our society" to redistribute wealth and power.
3264-"True compassion," King declared, "is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring."
3265-By 1967, King had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic.
3266-In his "Beyond Vietnam" speech delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- King called the United States "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today."
3267->From Vietnam to South Africa to Latin America, King said, the U.S. was "on the wrong side of a world revolution."
3268-King questioned "our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America," and asked why the U.S. was suppressing revolutions "of the shirtless and barefoot people" in the Third World, instead of supporting them.
3269-In foreign policy, King also offered an economic critique, complaining about "capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries."
3270-You haven't heard the "Beyond Vietnam" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it.
3271-Time magazine called it "demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi."
3272-The Washington Post patronized that "King has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people."
3273-In his last months, King was organizing the most militant project of his life: the Poor People's Campaign.
3274-He crisscrossed the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would descend on Washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol, if need be-- until Congress enacted a poor people's bill of rights.
3275-Reader's Digest warned of an "insurrection."
3276-King's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild America's cities.
3277-He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its "hostility to the poor"-- appropriating "military funds with alacrity and generosity," but providing "poverty funds with miserliness."
3278-How familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after King's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet.
3279-As 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the White House and Congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty.
3280-And so do most mass media.
3281-Perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of Martin Luther King's life.
3282------------------- Media Beat is Norman Solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics.
3283-Until 1996, the column was co-written by FAIR's founder, Jeff Cohen (Cohen no longer works at FAIR).

3382-It may be as addicting as heroin.
3383-The body goes through a physical "withdrawal" when the nicotine level drops - causing the "nicotine fit."
3384-Nicotine withdrawal can be very unpleasant - many smokers find it difficult to quit due to nicotine addiction.
3385-Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, craving nicotine, stomach problems, headaches and drowsiness.

3411-urlLink Halliburton subsidiary wins Iraqi oil firefighting contract  WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US army said it gave the main Iraqi oilwell firefighting contract to a unit of Halliburton Co., a firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney without any bidding.
3412-Kellogg, Brown and Root, a unit of Houston, Texas-based Halliburton, was handed the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been placed in charge of fighting the blazes.
3413-The contract had not been put out to tender, said the Corps spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Gene Pawlik.
3414-Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) had already been asked by the Pentagon (news - web sites) to draw up plans for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq (news - web sites), Pawlik noted.
3415-"It made the most sense to engage them in the near term as the company to get the mission done because they were familiar with the details of the fires themselves and what would be needed," he said.
3416-The value of the contract would depend on the scale of the work.
3417-The chief of Britain's armed forces, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, said Friday that Iraqi forces had set fire to seven oil wells in the south of the country.
3418-KBR would claim the cost of its services plus two to five percent depending on how it executed the job, Pawlik said.
3419-"KBR was selected for this award based on the fact that KBR is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice," the company said in a statement.
3420-KBR said it had teams of well control and engineering contractors preparing the initial phase.
3421-The company was given a free hand to choose subcontractors for the work, the Corps spokesman said.
3422-KBR chose Houston-based Boots and Coots International, with which it has a services and equipment partnership, and Wild Well Control Inc. as firefighting subcontractors.
3423-President George W. Bush (news - web sites)'s spokesman, Ari Fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details.
3424-Asked about the contracting process, Fleischer told a news conference: "The question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires.
3425-Refer your question to the agencies involved.
3426-I am not familiar with the details of this contract."
3427-In a statement late Monday, the Defense Department said the Army Corps of Engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities.
3428-Kellogg, Brown and Root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, Pentagon said.
3429-The contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said.
3430-"We have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment," Boots and Coots president Brian Krause said in a statement.
3431-"We will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure," he said.
3432-Boots and Coots was brought into Kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the Gulf War (news - web sites), it said.
3433-Cheney was chief executive of the KBR parent company Halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000.

3459-Voyeurism   urlLink War in the digital age: Did you see that?
3460-by Francis Till   Digital technology is bringing the war to the world in new, sometimes astonishingly immediate ways -- and the development is not always welcome.
3461-Anyone caught without a television, for example, can watch a free, live webcast of downtown Bagdhad on a computer screen, 24/7, courtesy BBC News.
3462-That link works on internet-capable PDAs, by the way, which can hook up to wireless nets and provide broadband streams to anyone in an 802.11x cloud, even over coffee in a Starbucks anywhere.
3463-Very early monday morning, that camera was trained on a bank of the Tigris river as Iraqi soldiers and police combed the reeds on the shore in search of what was later reported to be two downed American pilots.
3464-The soldiers fired their automatic weapons into the river, violating whatever passes these days for the rules of handling capture, small boats flitted about in the water, angry crowds gathered on the bridge and along the river road.
3465-The audio feed from the camera, which is adequate for loud sounds like traffic and bombs, caught the excited voices of the crowd and even some of the gunfire.
3466-Al Jazeera cameramen were with the soldiers and moments after the webstream fed the images into computers all over the world, very similar pictures began to bloom on television as the Qatar-based station put its images up to satellites.
3467-On BBC webstream 4, the talking heads in the newsroom were taking in the story and beginning to put it out to their global audience.
3468-BBC's webstream 4 is a duplicate feed of the news channel's broadcast, with slight variations: at times, it shows presenters during broadcast breaks, for example.
3469-According to the presenters, RAF sources said they could account for all their flights and none were missing.
3470-Within 10 minutes, they had quotes from senior officials at the Pentagon making similar statements about American aircraft.
3471-Yet, clearly, something was taking place on the banks of the Tigris, where some of the gathered crowd had begun tossing torches into the reeds, hoping to burn the hiding airmen out.
3472-Al Jazeera reported on television at that point that one American pilot had been captured and the crowd was searching for a second airman.
3473-According to Al Jazeera, both airmen had been seen parachuting into the river after their airplane had been shot down.
3474-Al Jazeera did not use modifiers.
3475-Sky news, at that point, began inserting tag frames onto a picture of the search that quoted US Central Command saying that no coalition planes had been shot down.
3476-On the webstream feed, the sky over Bagdhad began to show as a kind of eerie charcoal grey due to the plumes from burning oil pits, lit earlier in the day in a futile attempt to mask targets from the war planes and missiles.
3477-Meanwhile, the webcam broadcast the sounds of an incoming air attack.
3478-Hours before, webcams and television cameras had streamed out images of long range bombers leaving remote bases.
3479-Now, they were quite possibly arriving over their target.
3480-A target full of civilians, exposed and too far away from shelters to reach what passes for safety in Bagdhad today.
3481-As the crowd began to break up, heading for cover, word came over Sky News from American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that, indeed, a UK warplane, with two pilots, was missing.
3482-Not the Tornado shot down earlier by an American Patriot missile, but another.
3483-But then, it was revealed, he was speaking in only general terms, without specific knowlege.
3484-And finally, an astute BBC reporter pointed out that many things -- bombs, equipment -- came down from airplanes in parachutes.
3485-Which might explain the conspicuous absence of a crashed airplane.
3486-BBC World News, unfortunately anchored at that mid-afternoon (London time) hour by an earnest second-stringer, reported it by saying that Rumsfeld had said American soldiers were missing and that an "allied aircraft" was missing.
3487-BBC's on-the-scene reporter had a firmer grasp of events, reminding the somewhat febrile broadcaster of what had been said in Washington only moments before.
3488-To no avail -- because no matter how good the technology becomes, users will absorb only what they are willing to take in.
3489-In America, England, Australia -- the countries flying planes into danger -- families would have been watching the screens of televisions and computers with dread.
3490-They were taking everything in, according to the raw testimony of Nancy Chamberlin, the wife of a fallen Marine, who had told NBC anchor Tom Browkaw a day before that she deeply admired what "all of the new technology is doing today to bring it (the war) into our homes.
3491-But for the mothers and the wives who are out there watching it is murder.
3492-It's heartbreak.
3493-We can't leave the television.
3494-Every tank, every helicopter.
3495-Is that my son?"
3496-After she hung up the phone, Brokaw broke up on the air.
3497-"War is not about technology," he said.
3498-"Behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk," LostRemote reported.
3499-And, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to Bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots.
3500-And, perhaps, no plane shot down at all.
3501-It's difficult to lie when the cameras are on.
3502-And the cameras are always on, these days.
3503-Even at 50 miles-per-hour.
3504-Spectacular footage from NBC reporter David Bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain.
3505-The equipment is from Maritime Telecommunications Network (MTN), of Miramar, Florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed.
3506-But even though it is ALL digital, it's not all cameras.
3507-The websites of Iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online Friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic.
3508-The websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds.
3509-By Sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the Uruklink sites, and while the Iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to "live coverage" was broken.
3510-The Iraqi News Agency site, part of the Uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed.
3511-It contains an outdated link to the former website of the Iraq Satellite Channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a Christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime.
3512-According to Brian McWilliams of pc-radio.com, "Web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching Uruklink.net, the Iraq government's main website, after the US launched its initial attack Wednesday night.
3513-But those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of Internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing.
3514-"In fact, traffic to Uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site.
3515-The homepage of Uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today.
3516-That would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in December.
3517-The previous traffic record occurred on Feb. 9, when the site's address was published in the Drudge Report."
3518-McWilliams told Politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist Declan McCullagh, that the main Iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country's two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.
3519-We suggest sending email to Saddam.

        Why are Women Leaving Corporate America and Where are They Going?
3780-by Denise Grer   urlLink http://www.cobolreport.com/columnists/denise/07292002.asp   In todays fast paced world, people are expected to change jobs many times and even change careers several times in their lifetime.
3781-Even so, women are leaving corporate America at twice the rate of men.
3782-Why are they leaving and where are they going?
3783-Many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender.
3784-Many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling.
3785-Many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate America is not willing to give.
3786-Many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers.
3787-For all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses.
3788-A majority of these organizations are wildly successful.
3789-Women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the U.S. overall economic health and competitiveness.
3790-Why Are Women Leaving?
3791-Even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snails pace.
3792-The glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back.
3793-Thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions.
3794-In fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (Moore and Buttner 1997).
3795-In addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company.
3796-In a different study by Catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (Catalyst 1998).
3797-This suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments.
3798-This further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their companys direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility.
3799-In many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.
3800-This cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity.
3801-Another factor is many women feel they are undervalued.
3802-In fact, pay equity is still a problem.
3803-In the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (Chao 2001).
3804-More specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (USDoL 2001).
3805-Another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children.
3806-However there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children.
3807-This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers.
3808-To counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both.
3809-Many view this support as something the company should provide.
3810-When the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors.
3811-How Can Corporations Reverse This Trend?
3812-In todays knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections.
3813-The loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements.
3814-All of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (Donahue 1998).
3815-A corporations first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular.
3816-This could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews.
3817-Statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem.
3818-These could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria.
3819-Gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion.
3820-In particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company.
3821-It is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them.
3822-Based on this research, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented.
3823-It is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort.
3824-Managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity.
3825-Some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting.
3826-Women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (Van Velsor and Hughes 1990).
3827-Thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization.
3828-Another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued.
3829-This is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male).
3830-Other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation.
3831-Essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business?
3832-If business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women.
3833-Given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women.
3834-Characteristics and Culture of Women Owned Businesses Starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers.
3835-However, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility.
3836-They are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles.
3837-For high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology.
3838-Just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (NFWBO 2001b).
3839-This follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the U.S.
3840-The most recent statistics from the Department of Education show women graduates at 58.3% of B.S.
3841-graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (NCES 2001).
3842-No matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table.
3843-NFWBO found that 53% of women business owners emphasize right-brain thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (NFWBO 1994).
3844-The same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events.
3845-The attributes of a companys leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace.
3846-Women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in family terms and work within a network of business relationships.
3847-Men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (NFWBO 1994; Grer 2001).
3848-The NFWBO study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny.
3849-Men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals.
3850-Thus, womens leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a web of inclusion (see Grer 2001; Helgesen 1995), while mens leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach.
3851-Another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing.
3852-Only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do.
3853-For large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (NFWBO 1994).
3854-In addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses.
3855-Diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership.
3856-Not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce.
3857-Women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men).
3858-Men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (NFWBO 2000a).
3859-The Success of Women-Owned Businesses From an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful.
3860-In 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (NFWBO 1999).
3861-Of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue.
3862-These businesses are also financially stable.
3863-Women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all U.S. firms (CWBR 1995).
3864-Businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy.
3865-The growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (USCB 1997).
3866-From 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%.
3867-With respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (NFWBO 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector.
3868-Still Some Difficulties Even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender.
3869-One key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background.
3870-These are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success.
3871-Women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues.
3872-Only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms.
3873-In addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual angel investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (NFWBO 2000b).
3874-Women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (NFWBO 2001b).
3875-This reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity.
3876-Given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed.
3877-There are currently programs that strive towards these goals  many of which can be linked to via the Center for Women's Business Researchs website at http://www.nfwbo.org  Catalyst for Change?
3878-The management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well.
3879-Interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well.
3880-A recent survey of technology professionals by Webgrrls, in western New York, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (Drury 2001).
3881-Men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life.
3882-In addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities.
3883-It is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family.
3884-However, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments.
3885-The Webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men.
3886-Even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important.
3887-As the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving.
3888-The tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces.
3889-Regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women.
3890-These businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the Fortune 500 companies of the future.

3910-Alert: Total Lunar Eclipse Set Thursday  AP to My Yahoo!
3911-LOS ANGELES - If the weather cooperates, a total lunar eclipse will be seen across North America late Thursday  the first visible in the United States in three years  and just before dawn Friday in western Europe and western and southern Africa.
3912-A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth casts its shadow on the full moon, blocking the sunlight that otherwise reflects off the moon's surface.
3913-Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye.
3914-In North America, the moon will remain totally eclipsed for 53 minutes, and should turn substantially darker and reddish in color.
3915-The total eclipse will start at 8:13 PDT in Los Angeles, 11:13 p.m. EDT in New York.
3916-A second lunar eclipse, on Nov. 8, will be visible from North and South America.
3917-Eclipses once helped prove the Earth is round, because its shadow on the moon is curved.

3967-urlLink Researchers create flexible, paper-thin electronic screen  Associated Press  In a step toward electronic newspapers and wearable computer screens, scientists have created an ultra-thin screen that can be bent, twisted and even rolled up and still display crisp text.
3968-The material, only as thick as three human hairs, displays black text on a whitish-gray background with a resolution similar to that of a typical laptop computer screen.
3969-The screen is so flexible it can be rolled into a cylinder about a half-inch wide without losing its image quality.
3970-Although it's not quite the dream of single-sheet, electronic newspapers or books that can display hundreds of pages of text, its creators said it's the first flexible computer screen of its kind.
3971-``I think it's a major step forward.
3972-We have cleared a big obstacle in electronic paper development,'' said Yu Chen, a research scientist with E Ink Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.
3973-E Ink is one of several companies working to develop electronic ``paper'' for e-newspapers and e-books, and other possible applications -- even clothing with computer screens sewn into it.
3974-The new screen is described in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
3975-Aris Silzars, the past president of the San Jose, Calif.-based Society for Information Display, said one of the technology's first applications could be something like an electronic tablet lawyers could use in place of bulky laptops.
3976-But Silzars said the best uses of the new screen, which E Ink is still developing, may not be evident.
3977-``It's very hard to predict where this thing may go,'' he said.
3978-Chen and his co-workers made the 3-inch wide display screen flexible by developing a stainless steel foil topped with a thin layer of circuits that control an overlying film of electronic ink.
3979-That ``ink,'' developed in 1997 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, contains tiny capsules with black and white particles with opposing electrical charges floating in a clear fluid.
3980-When a negative voltage is run through circuits behind these capsules, the positive white particles move to the capsule's top.
3981-A positive current does the same to the negative black particles.
3982-The human eye blends these resulting patterns of black- or white-topped capsules into text displayed in a traditional column.
3983-Currently, information and power is fed to the screen through a wired hookup.
3984-But Chen's team is working on a self-contained system that could receive data through a wireless connection.
3985-They also hope to boost the speed at which the screen switches to a new ``page'' of text, from the current quarter of a second to at least 10 times as fast, so it can display video.
3986-Another goal is making the screen display a full range of colors.
3987-Robert Wisnieff, senior manager of IBM Corp.'s Advanced Display Technology Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said E Ink's flexible screen is something many futurists believe is crucial to making electronic screens part of every day life.
3988-He envisions such lightweight, thin screens being used for a credit card that could display the available balance or recent purchases.
3989-Another possible use is a jacket with a screen sewn into its sleeve to allow its wearer to read e-mail while on the run, check stock prices or access maps in an unfamiliar city.
3990-``This is a peek at the future,'' Wisnieff said.

4144-Fours have a deep and wide range of emotions and trust their subjective experience to make their life-decisions.
4145-They are frequently highly esthetic (not in talent, necessarily, but in concern), because they have a highly developed ability to think symbolically.
4146-This coupled with their emotional richness cries out for artistic expression.
4147-Fours make a personal statement in many things they do, from the way they dress to their choice of Impressionist paintings.
4148-They rather enjoy not being part of the crowd and have a natural sense of aristocracy.
4149-Taste, they maintain, is not determined by votes.
4150-When they are less healthy, their speech becomes lamentation as they claim their uniqueness because of their suffering.
4151-They often develop a spirit of entitlement to compensate for a feeling that somehow they are defective.
4152-This defect, paradoxically, is the basis for their claim that they deserve love.
4153-They make a claim on their friends' love because they have suffered and this suffering has made them more authentic - and so more lovable.

4175-- (Nan Yar?)
4176-As all living beings desire to be happy always, without misery, as in the case of everyone there is observed supreme love for one's self, and as happiness alone is the cause for love, in order to gain that happiness which is one's nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep where there is no mind, one should know one's self.
4177-For that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry of the form "Who am I?
4178-", is the principal means.
4179-1 .
4180-Who am I ?
4181-The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz.
4182-the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz.
4183-sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz.
4184-the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, I am not.
4185-2.
4186-If I am none of these, then who am I?
4187-After negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that Awareness which alone remains - that I am.
4188-3.
4189-What is the nature of Awareness?
4190-The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss   4.
4191-When will the realization of the Self be gained?
4192-When the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which is the seer.
4193-5.
4194-Will there not be realization of the Self even while the world is there (taken as real)?
4195-There will not be.
4196-6.
3255-Why?
4198-The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake.
4199-Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed.
4200-7.
4201-When will the world which is the object seen be removed?
4202-When the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear.
4203-8.
4204-What is the nature of the mind?
4205-What is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the Self.
4206-It causes all thoughts to arise.
4207-Apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind.
4208-Therefore, thought is the nature of mind.
4209-Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world.
4210-In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world.
4211-In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also.
4212-Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself.
4213-When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears.
4214-Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear.
4215-When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue).
4216-What is referred to as the Self is the Atman.
4217-The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone.
4218-It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).
4219-9.
4220-What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind?
4221-That which rises as 'I' in this body is the mind.
4222-If one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'I' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart.
4223-That is the place of the mind's origin.
4224-Even if one thinks constantly 'I' 'I', one will be led to that place.
4225-Of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'I' thought is the first.
4226-It is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise.
4227-It is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third.
4228-10.
4229-How will the mind become quiescent?
4230-By the inquiry 'Who am I?'.
4231-The thought 'who am I?'
4232-will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed.
4233-Then, there will arise Self-realization.
4234-11.
4235-What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'Who am I?'
4236-When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'To whom do they arise?'
4237-It does not matter how many thoughts arise.
4238-As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, "To whom has this thought arisen?".
4239-The answer that would emerge would be "To me".
4240-Thereupon if one inquires "Who am I?
4241-", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent.
4242-With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source.
4243-When the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear.
4244-Not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the Heart is what is called "inwardness" (antar-mukha).
4245-Letting the mind go out of the Heart is known as "externalisation" (bahir-mukha).
4246-Thus, when the mind stays in the Heart, the 'I' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the Self which ever exists will shine.
4247-Whatever one does, one should do without the egoity "I".
4248-If one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of Siva (God).
4249-12.
4250-Are there no other means for making the mind quiescent?
4251-Other than inquiry, there are no adequate means.
4252-If through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth.
4253-Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions.
4254-The source is the same for both mind and breath.
4255-Thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind.
4256-The thought "I" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity.
4257-It is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates.
4258-Therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent.
4259-But in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop.
4260-This is because of the will of God, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead.
4261-In the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled.
4262-Breath is the gross form of mind.
4263-Till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it.
4264-Therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa).
4265-Like the practice of breath-control.
4266-meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.
4267-Through meditation on the forms of God and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed.
4268-The mind will always be wandering.
4269-Just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone.
4270-When the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind Self-inquiry will become easy.
4271-Of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to Self-inquiry.
4272-13.
4273-The residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean.
4274-When will all of them get destroyed?
4275-As the meditation on the Self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed.
4276-14.
4277-Is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure Self?
4278-Without yielding to the doubt "Is it possible, or not?
4279-", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the Self.
4280-Even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep "O!
4281-I am a sinner, how can I be saved?
4282-"; one should completely renounce the thought "I am a sinner"; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the Self; then, one would surely succeed.
4283-There are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one.
4284-It is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious.
4285-When the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil.
4286-The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people.
4287-However bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them.
4288-Both desire and hatred should be eschewed.
4289-All that one gives to others one gives to one's self.
4290-If this truth is understood who will not give to others?
4291-When one's self arises all arises; when one's self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent.
4292-To the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good.
4293-If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere.
4294-15.
4295-How long should inquiry be practised?
4296-As long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry "Who am I?"
4297-is required.
4298-As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry.
4299-If one resorts to contemplation of the Self unintermittently, until the Self is gained, that alone would do.
4300-As long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands.
4301-16.
4302-What is the nature of the Self?
4303-What exists in truth is the Self alone.
4304-The world, the individual soul, and God are appearances in it.
4305-like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time.
4306-The Self is that where there is absolutely no "I" thought.
4307-That is called "Silence".
4308-The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is "I"; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self.
4309-17.
4310-Is not everything the work of God?
4311-Without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest.
4312-Just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of God that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas.
4313-God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him.
4314-That is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space.
4315-18.
4316-Of the devotees, who is the greatest?
4317-He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most excellent devotee.
4318-Giving one's self up to God means remaining constantly in the Self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the Self.
4319-Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them.
4320-Since the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not?
4321-We know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease?
4322-19.
4323-What is non-attachment?
4324-As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment.
4325-Just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the Self-Pearl.
4326-20.
4327-Is it not possible for God and the Guru to effect the release of a soul?
4328-God and the Guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release.
4329-In truth, God and the Guru are not different.
4330-Just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the Guru's gracious look will be saved by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release.
4331-One can know oneself only with one's own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else's.
4332-Does he who is Rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is Rama?
4333-21.
4334-Is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)?
4335-Just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the Self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the Self.
4336-The world should be considered like a dream.
4337-22.
4338-Is there no difference between waking and dream?
4339-Waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference.
4340-Just as waking happenings seem real while awake.
4341-so do those in a dream while dreaming.
4342-In dream the mind takes on another body.
4343-In both waking and dream states thoughts.
4344-names and forms occur simultaneously.
4345-23.
4346-Is it any use reading books for those who long for release?
4347-All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading.
4348-In order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one's Self is; how could this search be done in books?
4349-One should know one's Self with one's own eye of wisdom.
4350-The Self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them.
4351-Since the Self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books.
4352-There will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned.
4353-24.
4354-What is happiness?
4355-Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not different.
4356-There is no happiness in any object of the world.
4357-We imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects.
4358-When the mind goes out, it experiences misery.
4359-In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self.
4360-Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-Happiness.
4361-Thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the Self and returning to it.
4362-Under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching.
4363-A person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade.
4364-Someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool.
4365-A wise man stays permanently in the shade.
4366-Similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave Brahman.
4367-The mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to Brahman to experience happiness.
4368-In fact, what is called the world is only thought.
4369-When the world disappears, i.e.
4370-when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.
4371-25.
4372-What is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)?
4373-Remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight.
4374-To remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the Self.
4375-Telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight.
4376-26.
4377-What is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom?
4378-Desirelessness is wisdom.
4379-The two are not different; they are the same.
4380-Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object.
4381-Wisdom means the appearance of no object.
4382-In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the Self is wisdom.
4383-27.
4384-What is the difference between inquiry and meditation?
4385-Inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self.
4386-Meditation consists in thinking that one's self is Brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss.
4387-28.
4388-What is release?
4389-Inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage, and realising one's true nature is release.

4397-urlLink BBC NEWS | South Asia | Sanskrit struggles to survive  Monday, 5 August, 2002, 12:51 GMT 13:51 UK  Students say Sanskrit offers no job prospects  By Sanjeev Srivastava  BBC correspondent in Bombay    One of the oldest languages in the world, Sanskrit, is in danger of becoming extinct in India, the country of its origin.
4398-Although most Indian languages still use the basic grammar of Sanskrit, no more than a few thousand people in a country of more than one billion can claim to read, write and speak it fluently.
4399-What was once the language of the elite in ancient India, Sanskrit no longer enjoys the exalted status it once had.
4400-Poor job prospects   In Bombay's Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, one of the city's oldest and biggest education institutions.
4401-students recite Sanskrit shlokas.
4402-We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit    Sanskrit scholar Girish Jani   Only 150 students come here to learn this ancient language - a very small number if you compare it with the tens of thousands of students who go out every day to the city's schools and colleges.
4403-So why are so few students coming to learn Sanskrit?
4404-The school's principal, Narendra Kumar Singh says there are very few jobs for anyone studying Sanskrit.
4405-Some get jobs as priests   "At most, they can become a teacher in Sanskrit schools, Sanskrit colleges so their salaries are also very meagre."
4406-"The other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people," he added.
4407-Lacking relevance?
4408-The other reason why Sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses.
4409-It was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry.
4410-There are some who opt for Sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one's overall grades.
4411-But most students learn the language to know about the past.
4412-Some study Sanskrit to improve their grades.
4413-There is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning Sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most Sanskrit colleges are publicly funded.
4414-Critics of Sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses.
4415-However, Sanskrit scholars like Girish Jani rubbish this approach.
4416-"Why should we read Shakespeare?
4417-Why should we read Sartre?
4418-Are they connected really with the life in the first attempt?
4419-No.
4420-"We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit."
4421-Scholars like Mr Jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about Sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement,   But the sad reality is that Sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin.
4422-urlLink NASA researcher, Rick Briggs has written:   "In ancient India the intention to discover truth was so consuming, that in the process, they discovered perhaps the most perfect tool for fulfilling such a search that the world has ever known -- the Sanskrit language.
4423-There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own.
4424-Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century.
4425-Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence.
4426-This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millennia old.
4427-The discovery is of monumental significance.
4428-It is mind-boggling to consider that we have available to us a language which has been spoken for 4-7000 years that appears to be in every respect a perfect language designed for enlightened communication.
4429-But the most stunning aspect of the discovery is this: NASA the most advanced research center in the world for cutting edge technology has discovered that Sanskrit, the world's oldest spiritual language is the only unambiguous spoken language on the planet.
4430-Considering Sanskrit's status as a spiritual language, a further implication of this discovery is that the age old dichotomy between religion and science is an entirely unjustified one.
4431-It is also relevant to note that in the last decade physicists have begun to comment on the striking similarities between their own discoveries and the discoveries made thousands of years ago in India which went on to form the basis of most Eastern religions.
4432-Why has Sanskrit endured?
4433-Fundamentally it generates clarity and inspiration.
4434-And that clarity and inspiration is directly responsible for a brilliance of creative expression such as the world has rarely seen.
4435-Another hope for the return of Sanskrit lies in computers.
4436-Sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit.
4437-The precision play of Sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that would inevitably transform the world.
4438-In fact the mere learning of Sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will provide in the arena of future communication."

4533-urlLink South Seattle Star : Heap of the Week    Bill Jacobs' '69 Dodge van isn't pretty, but in some ways that makes it all the better for the uses he puts it to.
4534-On a recent sunny afternoon, the van held a load of llama manure bound for the vegetable beds at his Beacon Hill home, and a slant-6 engine Jacobs will install in another of his vehicles, a '63 Dart.
4535-And there was a Toyota engine in there, too.
4536-(Jacobs is partial to old Dodges and Toyotas.
4537-He also owns a banged-up Toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks.
4538-He replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.)
4539-The van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier.
4540-And then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years.
4541-One previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member.
4542-And back when the van was new it was an animal control truck.
4543-"I don't think they called it that back then," Jacobs said.
4544-"I think they called it the dog-catcher van.
4545-It was up in the San Juan Islands; I think that's why it has the rust."
4546-In the three or four years he has owned it, Jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission.
4547-"It was so much work getting it out, I figured I would do it all," he said.
4548-"I'm not going to tell you how much money I've put into it," he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van.
4549-"I found the van on the Internet," Jacobs said.
4550-"This guy wanted $400 for it.
4551-The picture looked so good, but when I got there it looked like (bleep!)."
4552-So Jacobs bargained the price down.
4553-"I paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt," he said.
4554-"They don't sell these anymore, so I had to have it rebuilt."
4555-Jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade ("I don't know if I'll keep doing this kind of work," he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is.
4556-And while he acknowledges that the van isn't in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it.
4557-"There's no way I could ever sell it and get back what I've put into it," he said.
4558-That rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but Jacobs admits the van doesn't run as well as it could.
4559-"It would be nice to say that," he said.
4560-"It doesn't run perfect, but it gets the job done."

4590-Even limitation must be limited, so that in attempting to bring order and direction into your life you do not choke off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity.
4591-Similarly, in groups and organizations, the rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too soft.

4636-The inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust.

4799-I replied "Two nans please."
4800-She remarked enthusiastically, "Oh, would you like to try the poori?"
4801-"No."
4802-She smiled on, "They are very nice.
4803-Have you tried them before?
4804-You should try!"
4805-I smiled weakly, "Okay one poori and one nan."
4806-I tried poori before, but prefer nan.
4807-But she was so unknowingly pushy that I patronised her.
4808-She walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, "Was the poori nice?"
4809-My friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod.
4810-She too prefers nan.
4811-The waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another "happy" customer.
4812-I call this "The Poori Effect."
4813-It is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one's perceptions.
4814-The waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite.
4815-Due to the way she carried herself, we "naturally obliged".
4816-We were later "obliged" to give her a positive response- out of "courtesy".
4817-The result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori.
4818-We might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion.
4819-We sometimes "unwittingly" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back.
4820-But is your smile true?
4821-On the other hand, is your smiling "forcing" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely?
4822-We see what we want to see.
4823-I know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs.
4824-The Poori Effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith.
4825-We are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback.
4826-This is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within.
4827-When we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too.
4828-Either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue.
4829-Can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way?
4830-Even if the truth bites a little, does it matter?
4831-Since it is "sugar-coated" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right?
4832-Asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind.
4833-Some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like.
4834-"No no, what does he know?
4835-Pooris are the best!"
4836-Do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you?
4837-But what is the truth about preferences and opinions?
4838-Preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the Buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory.
4839-Because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject.
4840-Everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less.
4841-Pooris might taste much better if I let go of my aversion?
4842-Nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers?
4843-Let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes.
4844-The more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others.
4845-When we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively.
4846-This is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment.
4847-Only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to Enlightenment!

4891-:  "Holotropic Breathwork is a powerful approach to self-exploration and healing that integrates insights from modern consciousness research, anthropology, various depth psychologies, transpersonal psychology, Eastern spiritual practices, and mystical traditions of the world.
4892-The name Holotropic means literally 'moving toward wholeness' (from the Greek 'holos'=whole and 'trepein'=moving in the direction of something).
4893-The process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated breathing with evocative music in a special set and setting.
4894-With the eyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness.
4895-This state activates the natural inner healing process of the individual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences.
4896-With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process, the quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for that particular time and place.
4897-While recurring themes are common, no two sessions are ever alike.
4898-Additional elements of the process include focused energy release work and mandala drawing.
4899-Holotropic Breathwork is usually done in groups, although individual sessions are also possible.
4900-Within the groups, people work in pairs and alternate in the roles of experiencer and 'sitter'.

4902-The same is true for trained facilitators, who are available as helpers if necessary."

S. Mahawatte   Almost all religions in the world except Buddhism have as their foundation a creator God and an immortal soul.
5112-Let us briefly examine the core beliefs of a few of these religions.
5113-The core belief in Hinduism is, after death one joins Paramathma.
5114-They are required to have utmost Faith in the Trio- Brahma - (Creator); Vishnu - (Ruler) and Shiva- (Destroyer) of the Universe.
5115-To them, Moksya could be achieved only after death.
5116-There are other gods such as Ganapathy and Skanda and by having faith in them, they can pray to enable them to find security and lead prosperous lives.
5117-Buddhists, too, visit these Kovils and pray to these Gods seeking mundane help to overcome their various day to day problems.
5118-But unlike Hindus, the Buddhists perform meritorious acts and transfer the merit thus acquired, to Gods and seek their help.
5119-According to Buddhism Gods are unable to commit meritorious acts by themselves.
5120-The Buddha said that people pray out of fear and that fear is due to inability to understand things as they really are.
5121-This is due to Avijja - nescience or ignorance and the Buddha has taught his disciples how to develop the Wisdom needed to bring to an end this Avijja.
5122-Almighty God  Christianity which came to be long after Hinduism also believes in an Almighty God as the creator of the universe.
5123-They are expected to have complete faith in the Trinity - Father, Son and the Holy Ghost.
5124-This appears to have some similarity to the Hindu trio Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
5125-Their Mokshya which they believe as joining their soul with the Creator, can be achieved only after death and that too, only with Gods love and repenting for their sins and prayer.
5126-They cannot achieve Mokshya by their own efforts.
5127-Islam also requires absolute faith in Almighty Allah and is also based on Atma - Soul and to have utmost faith in the Creator God and to pray daily, so that after death they join their Creator - Mokshya.
5128-The followers of the above religions hold fast to the belief that there is an immortal soul somewhere within them, which they want to continue to exist forever, by joining with their Creator.
5129-Let us now listen to what the Buddha had to say on this subject.
5130-A Bhikku once asked the Buddha Ven.
5131-Sir, is there a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found.
5132-The Buddha said Yes, Bhikku there is.
5133-A man has the following view.
5134-The Universe is that Atman, I shall be that after death, permanent, abiding, everlasting, unchanging and I shall exist as such for eternity.
5135-He hears the Thathagatha or a disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the complete destruction of all speculative views ... aiming at the extinction of Thirst Thanha, aiming at detachment, cessation Nirvana.
5136-Then that man thinks I will be annihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be no more.
5137-So he mourns, worries himself, laments, weeps, beating his breasts and become bewildered.
5138-Thus O Bhikku, there is a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found (from What the Buddha taught by late Dr. Walpola Rahula thera).
5139-"After planting, the seed requires adequate amount of water, fertilizer, sunshine, and air to grow.
5140-By having the suitable karmic affinity, the sapling will grow into a healthy tree."
5141-- Venerable Master Cheng Yen         
       Cancer Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com): You are apt to get the feeling that the grass is greener on the other side today, dear Cancer.
5142-Try not to get too hung up on this concept.
5143-Either make the effort to cross the bridge and go where the landscape looks richer and more fruitful, or simply stay where you are.
5144-The key for true happiness is to make sure that regardless of where you end up, that you are enjoying the spot where you currently are.

        urlLink Metagifted Education Resource Organization: Introduction to Indigo Children :  What's an Indigo Child?
5162-by Wendy H. Chapman  Indigo Children are the current generation being born today and most of those who are 8 years old or younger.
5163-They are different.
5164-They have very unique characteristics that set them apart from previous generations of children.
5165-The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability.
5166-These are the children who are often rebellious to authority, nonconformist, extremely emotionally and sometimes physically sensitive or fragile, highly talented or academically gifted and often metaphysically gifted as well, usually intuitive, very often labeled ADD, either very empathic and compassionate OR very cold and callous, and are wise beyond their years.
5167-Does this sound like yourself or your child?
5168-Indigos have come into this world with difficult challenges to overcome.
5169-Their extreme levels of sensitivity are hard to understand and appreciate by parents who don't share this trait.
5170-Their giftedness is unusual in such high numbers.
5171-Their nonconformity to systems and to discipline will make it difficult to get through their childhood years and perhaps even their adult years.
5172-It is also what will help them accomplish big goals such as changing the educational system, for instance.
5173-Being an Indigo won't be easy for any of them, but it foretells a mission.
5174-The Indigo Children are the ones who have come to raise the vibration of our planet!
5175-These are the primary ones who will bring us the enlightenment to ascend.
5176-There's a very good chance your child is an Indigo if he/she was born after 1992.
5177-About 85% or higher of children born in '92 or later, 90% born in '94 or after and 95% or more born now (some even say 99%) are Indigo Children!
5178-Does this mean you aren't one if you were born prior to 1992?
5179-No!
5180-I've heard reports that they started coming in the 80s, but that means coming in larger numbers.
5181-I believe there have been Indigos born in every year, but perhaps not in high enough percentages to notice their presence and see what makes them so unique.
5182-So can you be a 24 yr old Indigo or a 50 year old one?
5183-Yes!

5192-"It is critical to serve others,  to contribute actively to others' well-being.
5193-I often tell practitioners that they should adopt  the following principle:     regarding one's own personal needs,       there should be       as little involvement or obligation as possible,    but regarding service to others,        there should be        as many possible involvements       and obligations as possible.

        urlLink FTAA lite seen as deal-breaker  By STEVEN CHASE Miami  Canada and other countries warned yesterday that a bid by the United States and Brazil to significantly narrow the scope of a proposed free-trade area of the Americas agreement could derail the talks under way in Miami.
5268-A group opposed to the barebones deal  including Canada, Chile, and Mexico  says the 'FTAA lite' salvage proposal Washington and Brasilia have cobbled together to salvage talks is insufficient to keep negotiations moving forward.
5269-'This is simply a papering over of differences and is not enough to establish a basis for continuing [talks],' a source close to FTAA negotiations in Miami said yesterday.
5270-The move by Washington and Brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator FTAA deal, ridiculed as 'FTAA lite', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the Western Hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers.
5271-It would fall grievously short of the sweeping and comprehensive 'NAFTA on steroids' goal envisaged in 1994, when preparatory FTAA negotiations first began among all countries in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba.
5272-Trade watchers are increasingly suspicious that the United States' only aim in Miami is to keep talks alive until the meeting ends Nov. 21.

       "At the new moon, the lunar gravity pulls water up, and causes the seeds to swell and burst.
5893-This factor, coupled with the increasing moonlight creates balanced root and leaf growth.
5894-This is the best time for planting above ground annual crops that produce their seeds outside the fruit.
5895-Examples are lettuce, spinach, celery, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and grain crops.
5896-Cucumbers like this phase also, even though they are an exception to that rule.
5897-In the second quarter the gravitational pull is less, but the moonlight is strong, creating strong leaf growth.
5898-It is generally a good time for planting, especially two days before the full moon.
5899-The types of crops that prefer the second quarter are annuals that produce above ground, but their seeds form inside the fruit, such as beans, melons, peas, peppers, squash, and tomatoes.
5900-Mow lawns in the first or second quarter to increase growth.
5901-After the full moon, as the moon wanes, the energy is drawing down.
5902-The gravitation pull is high, creating more moisture in the soil, but the moonlight is decreasing, putting energy into the roots.
5903-This is a favorable time for planting root crops, including beets, carrots, onions, potatoes, and peanuts.
5904-It is also good for perennials, biennials, bulbs and transplanting because of the active root growth.
5905-Pruning is best done in the third quarter, in the sign of Scorpio.
5906-In the fourth quarter there is decreased gravitational pull and moonlight, and it is considered a resting period.
5907-This is also the best time to cultivate, harvest, transplant and prune.
5908-Mow lawns in the third or fourth quarter to retard growth."

5949-: What makes people ticklish?
5950-Arden Dallas, Texas   Dear Arden: Being ticklish is a complicated trait rooted in our evolutionary past.
5951-Two searches, 'physiology + ticklish' and 'why are we ticklish,' turned up a number of articles that helped us understand this touchy, feely human feature.
5952-Scientists suggest that being ticklish is our defense against creepy crawlies like spiders and bugs, a physiological response alerting us to a specific type of threat.
5953-That is why vulnerable parts of our bodies -- feet, chest, and armpits, are among the most ticklish.
5954-While there is no question that being ticklish is neurological, scientists contend that it is also learned.
5955-One theory sees ticklishness as a personality-based response to perceived attack.
5956-Antsy folks may laugh uncontrollably at the lightest touch, or even without being touched at all, while folks made of sterner stuff won't budge during more aggressive tickle attacks.
5957-If you close your eyes and try to remain calm while you are tickled, you can decrease panic, reduce giggles, and dull sensation.
5958-And, no matter how hard you try, it is nearly impossible to tickle yourself.
5959-Tickling satisfies our human need to touch.
5960-Robert R. Provine, a professor of neuroscience and author of Quest for Laughter, sees the tickle as a form of communication between friends, family, and lovers, playing a key role in the evolution of social and sexual behavior.
5961-He points to chimps tickling each other during play, parents tickling little kids, and lovers tickling each other affectionately.
5962-'If you think the social component is not important,' Provine says, 'Try tickling a stranger.'

6405-urlLink Warning: nicotine seriously improves health  Robin McKie, science editor Sunday July 18, 2004 The Observer   Nicotine could soon be rehabilitated as a treatment for schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as hyperactivity disorders.
6406-Research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders.
6407-Some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of Parkinson's symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics.
6408-'A whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,' said Dr Dan McGehee, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago.
6409-'However, such benefits do not justify smoking.
6410-The lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide.
6411-On the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.'
6412-Nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure.
6413-This effect leads to a person's addiction.
6414-More than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics.
6415-But smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent.
6416-'The assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,' said McGehee.
6417-'They are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.'
6418-This point is backed by Dr Tony George, of Yale University.
6419-'Smoking is a marker for psychopathology,' he states in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine.
6420-Similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells.
6421-'Either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in Parkinson's, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy Parkinson's cells,' said McGehee.
6422-'Either way, the effect is noticeable.'

0-       this blog is not about spooge         
       this is a test to show my mother what a weblog is and how easy they are to start, but she doesnt give a shit         
       this is a test to show my mother what a weblog is and how easy they are to start, but she doesnt give a shit         
       not too shabby.
1-i had already eaten dinner, plus earlier a couple of chips with guac, several deviled eggs and some olives.
2-took meds at 5:45         
       well, i didnt really eat a breakfast - several slices of pepperoni and a large english cuke.
3-However at TJ's I had a small cup of coffee and cream and I just wolfed down a cup of cottage cheese.
4-I dont know how soon the sugar soars after ingestion.
5-time for a med.
6-i either mised my glipizid this morning or taking an extra one for lunch.
7-okay okay okay.
8-we know that even if I dont eat, if I dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud?
9-I think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when I took the last meds, so I will need to talk to the doc about that.
10-I took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it.
11-meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm.
12-so taking meds now to abate dinner, but I think the problem with morning blood may be the time between meds?
13-Last night however, i took them rather late, because I ate rather late.
14-I will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we'll see what happens in the am.
15-but even if I get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds.
16-good luck to me.
17-ps, I ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.
18-bleh.
19-ANYWAY, still way less carbs than normal         
       not too shabby, i am feeling a little lightheaded and trying to gauge when my sugars are low or high.
20-i took one glucophage at 1pm but did not eat.
21-about 90 min ago I had a about 10 raisens (naughty, probably 15 carbs just there) and a bowlful of broccoli and cheese.
22-This eaten at least two hours after taking my meds.
23-yeah buddie!
24-Had 4 eggs and chorizo for breakfast, snack was en entire english cuke.
25-sippin on splenda kool-aid right now.
26-no ttoo hungry for lunch.
27-I have not been taking the metabo boosters, I think they were nauseating me         
       so... whats the secret?
28-last night i took my meds at ten and I had, only 4 eggs con chorizo - 4 carbs.
29-nothing for 10 hours.
30-why is my blood sugar so fucking high?
31-dammit  also, I feel heavy today.
32-total carbs yesterday less than 60, so what gives.
33-had an entire english cuke about 4:00 and half a nasty atkins shake just a bit ago.
34-I havent had meds since 1pm and my blood is 114.
35-YES!
36-time for meds and some flank steak.
37-big bowl of kale soup - about 20 carbs  half cup cottage cheese - 5 carbs  one glucophage and one glipizid.
38-i'm still hungry!
39-not too good.
40-lets see, I took the evening meds at about 5:30, but i ended up eating a big meal at about 9 or 10.
41-I did not eat lunch, but I had an english cucumber with dressing - 6 carbs - when i took the meds, in an hour or two i was starving, so i ate about 3\4 cup of cottage cheese - 7 carbs, big hunk o' mozzarella - 4 carbs and a big bowl of kale soup - 17 carbs.
42-total carbs for the day less than 40, but most of them more than t hours after I took my last meds.
43-conclusion:   - meds are fast acting, I should eat right after I take them.
44-- I shouldn't eat after 9pm maybe even earlier.
45-HOWEVER - I haven't eaten a thing in over 8 hours, so really, this is not good.
46-Also, yesterday I woke feeling light and airy.
47-Today I feel heavy.
48-40 carbs is probably about 500 carbs less than I normally eat in a day AND I took all three glucophage and both glipizid.
49-I really do not want to start shootin up insulin, dammit.
50-blogging from my skytel pager kicks ASS!!
51-breakfast, two eggs and several pepperoni slices, a large bottle of tea java.
52-about 3 carbs total.
53-took glucophage and glipizid just before eating.
54-3 hours later blood sugar at 145. not too shabby, but it should have gone down more.
55-YES!!!!
56-135!!!!!
57-alrighty then.
58-today  3 eggs, cheese, bacon, avacado, sour cream and tomato omlette - about 10 carbs  half a pria bar - 2 carbs  3 eggs, most of a lo-carb tort, 1\2 cup beans with cheese about 28 carbs  not bad but i felt nauseous all day         
       five hours later, blood is 190. maybe i should create a blood blog and link it.
59-will figure it all out later.
60-I want to track food, blood sugar, exercise and my thoughts.
61-I want to RAH RAH SIS BOOM BAH myself.
62-I want this scooter, its a 64' model just like me, and green flatters me so:     urlLink scooter love   or this (freakin AWESOME):   urlLink  more scooter love   and look at all these yummy ones!
63-urlLink  scooter woodstock   i will treat myself when i reach goal         
       dont feel well.
64-dont know if its the metabo boosters or the glucophage, but i havent felt well all week, upset stomache.
65-three hours and one glucophage later my bloo is at 202. things are worse than I imagined.
66-the good news is, im watching it.
67-perhaps the glucophage needs to kickin over a period to have me be more responsive, I am going to start taking cinnamon at least 1 tsp a day, per a report i read that some people are usoing that and diet alone to regulate thier sugars.
68-it is obvious that the correct diet (less than 60 carbs a day should be more than sufficient) is not enough for me to combat this.
69-i know im getting obsessive, but i need to get a handle on this goddamn sugar crisis.
70-crap.
71-full night of fasting plus glucophage and glpizid, and my sugars are still 185. what kinda crap is that?
72-I really should re-read the atkins book before starting.
73-do i want to jump into full on induction phase eating 20 carbs or less a day, or acclimatize myself?
74-I dont know.
75-I think i lived on t-bone steak, cream cheese celery and macadamia nuts the first time.
76-blah         
       235 one hour after dinner.
77-I had a glucophage this morning and hardly any carbs all day.
78-this is depressing.
79-after fasting my sugar should be at 120 or less, after eating i think at 150.
80-I should be taking three glucophage a day and two glipizid.
81-its apparent to me that even if I ate nothing, my blood sugar is high, how do you escape that?
82-fuck.
83-I hope if my weight goes down to 150, the diabetes will go away.
84-thats the goal anyway.
85-poop.
86-tommorrow is another day            
       its not working.
87-:( maybe the skytel email isnt fast enough, but what the hell?
88-my pop just offered me one grand for every ten pounds i lose.
89-i need to lose about 100.   thanks dad, i love you         
       shrimp louie salad - 12 carbs can of black olives - 9 carbs protein bar - 3 carbs smart water - 0 carbs big juicy steak - 0 carbs  3 cups zuchinni w\ little onion - 15 carbs  half a big cucumber - 4 (fiber?)
90-all in all not bad,   plus 2 booster pills with cayanne, greentea leaf etc.
91-I have not officially weighed myself yet, will do that at the gym tommorrow.
92-urlLink    me july 4 last year.
93-good pic, doesn't show chins three and four urlLink            
       i am almost 40 going on 14. i weigh in at about 240 my blood sugar is high.
94-close to 200. i am losing my hair (thanks hormones)  last week at my optomitrist, she said if i keep this up, in 8 years i will have retinopathy.
95-not sure what that is exactly, but it dosn't sound good.
96-So, I begin the atkins plan, medication therapy for my hormones and some sort of exercise (sorry hair, you're sol)  and this is the blog.
97-each journey begins with one step         
       woke up at five am,,, realized I hadnt taken my last glucophage last night!!!!!
98-(and I had some carb solutions ice cream at 11pm, bad kitty) so I tested, fearing the worst, and I was at 76!!!...
99-so I took the glucophage and woke up now to 81.
100-SO what is the moral of this story?
101-is the glucophage raising my sugars at night?
102-wtf is going on ?
103-im so confused.
104-ham sandwich for lunch, about 1:30. i had some cereal for breakfast, thats it.
105-took glucophage at 2pm.
106-had stiry fry fresh green beans for dinner, yum, with a hamburger patty.. earlier, around 4pm had about a cup of carb options butter pecan, which was extrodinarily good.. Its now about 2 hours since dinner, and I have not had any meds since lunch.. so my blood sugars leveled off nicely on thier own.
107-took glipizid just now,, will take gluch before bed.
108-ho hum.
109-:)         
       not bad.
110-again, to tired to get up at 4am to take meds.
111-dammit.
112-but, what I did yesterday as take glipizid with dinner.. and 2 hours later I was at 95 which is great.. and then took the glucophage at midnight.
113-I will try that again tonight.
114-last night blood was 110, which wasnt bad since I ate late, didnt take meds till 40 min after dinner, and had a huge peice of so-call sugar free candy before going to sleep at about eleven.
115-I guess it realy is sugar free then.
116-thank god  i finished it and can only buy it fromt he traveling road show at costco.
117-anyhoo.. could not rouse my self to test and take meds at 4:30. so 7:20 blod was 111 and thats not too bad.
118-Blood has been okay i guess.. 110, 119 afte reating, 99 before aft.
119-snack.
120-the people on the atkins board seem to think that fasting sugars above 100 are nt acceptable, while the ADA seems to think that up to 120 fasting is okay.
121-so who is right?
122-I dont think there is damage at under 120.. and my levels after eating (within one hour havent been over 140 and within 2 hours have been about 120-126, which is okay.
123-the problem niggling me has been the morning sugars.
124-there is definately something going on.
125-the glucophage i beleive just increases the insulin sensitivity, the glipizid, im not sure, but I beleive it actualy decrease the sugar.
126-So.. im going to do too things, not take my meds until after dinner, about 10 pm, and in the am, take the glipizid at 4:30 and the glucophage before breakfast.
127-so there.
128-i got the blues.
129-okay, trying to outsmart this thing, I set the alarm for 4:30 am, to test and take my morning meds early.
130-I couldnt rouse myslef till five, and I tested (on my arm) at 114.
131-I took only glucophage, thinking both might be too much, and what about breakfast?
132-went back to sleep and woke up at 9am, and my blood is 121.   shit.
133-then i immediately tested my leg, which showed at 130!
134-so the good news is, I've been probably testing too high, since leg was my testing site of choice, and  I' supposed  to be testing from my fingers or arm.
135-however, i cannot seem to beat this fucking high morning sugar thing.
136-tommorrow I will trytaking just hte glipizid, and next day, both.
137-but now I have to see if its going to scew up my breakfast reaction.
138-Had about 9 grams carbs with high fiber ceral and cream this morning.
139-i'm having one.
140-although my blood sugars (hereafter known as BS) are pretty close to normal now, and my blood pressure is down as well as my pulse rate, Im pissed at my body.
141-Im pissed that missing my meds even at this low a carb intake, causes major BS spikes, i'm not losing any weight and none of these changes has improved my housekeeping skills.
142-bad day, but sugars normal.
143-30 day avg is 110!
144-this pains me.
145-I had a salad and a nasty atkins banna muffin for dinner, and I ate at about 7pm ish.. definately didnt have any food after 8 and took my meds when I ate dinner.
146-so do I eat before six, do i take my meds late?
147-do i take only the glipizid at dinner... i dont know.
148-it just pisses me off that I am so reducing my  carb intake and still have high morning bloods .
149-also, I had a dream last night, part of which included me making a take home plate at a party, from a table groaning with many many different kinds of pie.
150-pie.
151-ok and someone mentioned making faux apple pie with jicama.
152-whaddayathink?
153-14 day avg 105  30 day avg 114  no breakfast (baaaaad kitty) salad and klondike bar for lunch - 8 carbs leftover stirfry for snack - 5 carbs         
       finally!
154-- now I dont know if thats because i had stir fry only for dinner (because I ate late) or if I took my pills so late.
155-i may even have double up, but i usually get a tummy ache when I do, and i feel fine.
156-anyhoo I am not knockin it.
157-yay!
158-urlLink eBay item 4130354226 (Ends Jul-08-04 17:19:29 PDT) - Lens Kit for 3Com HomeConnect WebCam/Camera          
       AND i had a klondike fudggickle less than an hour ago (3 carbs total)  im feeling kinda fat tho, i need to gear up for atkins induction to drop some weight..  i am going to test and micromanage a one month menu, before I begin, then it should be easy sailin.
159-good things :  tiny lamb roasts saute'd in olive oil and fresh garlic flap meat marinated in soy and flame grilled klondike lo-carb bars ben and j's no sugar added strawberry pork tacos (soft) with la tortilla factory wheat tillas cukes koolaid          
       blah.
160-the bad news is, they found a spot on my retina, and now i have to get dilated and checked (my eyeball, not my coochy, get yer mind outta the gutter) for any more abnormalities.
161-good news is if I keep going with my sugars as I am, the problem should be arrested right here.
162-weird news, I decided to take back my new frames (the bifocals) because the reading glass portion wasn't strong enough and i couldn't read my beloved adult swim text from my usual perch on my bed, anymore.
163-it seems that the blood sugar effects the lens thickness of my cornea, and now, 30 days later, my prescription has changed.
164-so they are redoing the lenses.
165-good thing, because the photo gray dip was crap, and they needed to dip again.
166-haven't eaten much today and i need to make dinner for myself and the mijo.
167-morning blood was 110, current blood is 90 and forgive me, but i will not stop congratulating myself for  doing well with the blood.
168-urlLink oh lord i love this    she really irks me, that omarosa         
       no posts ent thru while i was on vaycay, which is wierd, because they showed successful as emails from my bloody pager.
169-blah balh, cheated here and there, blood sugar was okay for the most part.
170-I have to get out of the mind set that i need to be below 100 for regular checks, mom and dad are not, so its cool to be 110 or 108. my 30 day average is below 120, and thats grand.
171-i am going to register a new domain so i can multi blog here, side blog daily blood and carb counts, et al.
172-this will cost about 80 bucks for 2 year domain reg and 1 year hosting (@logjamming.com, yay), so be tuned for a change.
173-my main goal right now is getting this house in order and keeping the blood sugars low.
174-on the horizon, need to pay for west la ticket, ians sleep away camp, and car registration, with ins looming on the horizon.
175-there fore i bought some clothes and make up.

178-this is great.. had jello and whipped cream when i woke up (couldn't resist) and Mom took me to carrows, where I had a salad, 2 eggs and bacon, and hot tea with cream.. total breakfast about 12 carbs.
179-less than 2 hours later i am lower than when i woke up, sugar wise, which is a big deal.
180-still packing for the trip, heading out in a couple of hours.
181-i think i could live on this and whipped cream.
182-nuff said         
       WAHOO!
183-going to bd bllod at 11:30 was 125 and I was sad..thinking this morning was going to be bad... but I think I ate too late and didnt wait long enough to test.
184-so.
185-thats cool then.
186-doenst explaoin other high sugar mornings when i've gone to bed with bloo in the high 80s or low 90s.
187-anyhoo..  yay!
188-ok. morning blood 2 hours after breakfast, 92. had delicious black tea with cream and about 3/4 tsp of cinnamon, which is supposed to lower my blood sugar.
189-40min later i can feel it, im getting hot etc, and i know the use it alot in metabo boosters, so i test, but my blood is 96. oh well, i should prob wait a little longer and test again :p

200-later, around 5:30 pm and just after a couple of chips )oops) it was 107. havent taken evening meds, yet, waiting till 9pm.. having a salad now, steak later.
201-this hormone thing is getting out of control.
202-dawson's creek is making me cry.
203-dammit         
       not too bad, but it should really be in the 80's.
204-breakfast - tw waffles, two eggs, 13.5 carbs         
       took my meds at 9, hope it stays low.. not eating tonight         
       i don't know wht i havent  eaten anything since this aft.
205-although about 7 minutes ago  i drank an "emergen-C" vitamin packet.
206-about 4 carbs, and all of them sugar.. i'll test again in an hour.
207-I finally did it, all but the bottom shelf.
208-WHEW!
209-4 grocery bags stuffed with food, lots of pasta, pancake mix, jello, jello, jello... big part of me is wanting to save it, what a waste..
210-I think we are taking it the the homeless shelter later...  any way, delete all the crap from the house, so i am not tempted, or ian, when there is nothing "legal" to eat.
211-so far we've been okay, but i've been meaning to do this for some time.
212-actually filled two trash cans with stuff that could not be used, opened bags of pasta, old candy, two bags of unsweetened shredded coconut (unopened, but circa last atkins attempt, bag read "sell before dec 2000" haahaha)  alrighty then, current blood is 97         
       actually I didnt wake up until ten, and of course hadnt had meds for 13 hours.
213-i really need to wake up at 5 am, if only to take the meds.
214-reading some atkins bb, i found several interesting diabetes tidbits.
215-most of them scaring the hell out of me.. i can't keep dwelling on the damage done, can only go forward, ut i hope im not incapacitated in ten years time.
111-dammit.
217-also found out that many many people have the phenom of going to sleep with good sugars and waking up with high sugars.
218-everyone is different, and as I suspected, I am going to have to play with my schedule and diet to get it right..  mom suggested hot tea and cinnamon before going to sleep, i think thats a good idea.
219-i've been slightly snacking all morning.. heart of palm, .5 carb, 5 so7y flax chips 2.66 carbs, deviled eggs and some chorizo 6 carbs, ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge CHUNK!
220-5 carbs.
221-current blood for this aft is 89.  yay.
222-yippidy do dah         
       even tho i was snacking all morning, - two lo carb waffles 11 carbs, two lo carb klondyke bars, 10 carbs.
223-english cuke with dressing 5 carbs, 1.5 chicken spinach fontina sausages 1.5 carbs .... and still 94, which is great.
224-i wonder if there is a time release glucophage for night time, or if i should add some meds i dont know.
225-any hooo.. cant stop munching today.
226-having an avocado with chips - 11 carbs.
227-i dont know how, but im back on track.
228-yee haw         
       i just dont understand.
229-back to the drawing board         
       nothing since 10:30 am except meds and my blood is 118. what gives???????
230-this is great.
231-pre lunch blood is 114, down signifcantly in one hour.
232-all in all I think i am doing well.
233-30 day average 125, still very good.
234-stats say 70-140 is normal.. or considered okay.
235-I want better than normal.
236-based on how I am feeling now, and how i was feeling before, even before I gave birth, this problem had probably been borderline for sometime, also ... many overweight people never get this, or when they do, they are topping the scales over 300...
237-I was never near that, so i have to assume its in my genes.
238-so no blaming.
239-ok. later         
       this isnt bad, less than 40 ,min since i finished a meal at the california culinary acadamy, my young cousins class hosted a luau, i had a breaded shrimp, lobster salad, teriayaki chicken, roast pork, three lamb loin chops and some veggies as well as several bites of various desserts.. probably intook at least 50 carbs.
240-(but i didnt eat any bread or entire dessert, i maintained).
241-then I went to starbucks with my mom, blackiced tea with cream - 2 carbs and we got into a spat, blah blah, what else is new?
242-so i will simmmer down, i walked home.
243-what the hell is going on?
244-im not doing anything different than before!
245-Crap!
246-mom hadn't seen  me for about 4 weeks, and she said she could see a differnce in my appearance immediately.
247-i think its just the water.. i carry about 20 lbs in water retention... but still.. its something.
248-had some hearts of palm - 2 carbs and bag of no carb citrus slices (66 sugar alcohol.
249-one hour later my blood was 135!!!
250-apparently they DO effect my blood sugar.
251-had 2.5 fried tacos on mission whole wheat lo-carb tortillas - 10 carbs and some clavasita (zucchini with onion tomato and cheese) 8 carbs.
252-good dinner.
253-took my meds at 7pm, was still snacking a bit on veggies at 8pm, my blood sugar is now 116. it's not been a banner day here.
254-i feel headachey, fat, bloated and generaly disgruntled, blood was 104 just now and 110 2 hours ago, havent eaten since 10:30 am, i should be lower!!!
255-while this isn't horrible, i wish it were lower.
256-espcially since i've been hungry since breakfast.. i think it was really just the cheesy bread, so savory, made me want to eat something good.
257-well i'm not going to fight it, but I'm going to have a salad.
258-6 carbs.
259-avocado, cuke, cheese, lettuce, cilantro, pepperoni         
       lo-carb waffle - 5.5 lo-carb orowheat 1 slice - 6 carbs 2 eggs and cheese - 3 carbs  total 14.5  by the way, orowheat breat, liberally applied with clearman's cheese spread (no carbs) is a DELIGHT.
260-yeesh.
261-i had ben and jerrys 1\2 cup no sugar added deliciousness last night at 9pm, right after i took my meds... but i still don't understand the chemistry of all this.
262-ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge chunk, 18 carbs per half cup minus 5 carbs fiber minus 8 carbs sugar alchohol.
263-5 cabrs per serving!!!!
264-yippee!!!!
265-okay.. i need to try the lo carb heaven one now..          
       had dinner about 8,  pork stir fry and a lo-carb dessert - total carbs 9, had several eggs about 4 - 5 carbs didnt take my meds till just now.
266-after dinner blood is 110, whis is great         
       i havent eaten since this morning or taken meds.
267-had half a STRIVE bar (very very good, but about 33 sugar alchohol type carbs, doesnt seem to have effected my blood sugars at all.
268-Had one lo-carb waffle and 4 eggs for breakfast (deviled) 9.5 carbs.
269-half a strive bar and iced tea with cream 4.5 carbs.
270-im not really hungry tho.
271-but i should eat.
272-i beleive consistant eating schedule is key to the sugars.
273-but quien sabes que?
274-morning blood 107 poop i had a large salad and a locarb klondyke bar 13 carbs total?
275-after 8pm took meds at i, actually had the icecream at 10pm live and 'earn.
276-i feel heavy          
       cruisin'         
       plans for this blog -   multi blog includes to track carbs and blood.
277-blog link strictly for lo-carb food reviews.
278-blog link to picture tracking.
279-new color scheme  - toying with a tree green or a sunny orange on white.
280-maybe some sort of include, for the multi mini blogs on the side.
281-i need help!
282-and or a long weekend  I am pretty fucking excited tho, because so far this experience has been very calm... none of the desperation of a diet, even the first one, considering the impetus was going blind in the not to distant future.
283-it suprisingly easy.
284-but i am not pushing hard on the weight loss, i'm pushing hard on the sugar control.
285-both ian and i have been eating lots more veggies, but i should look into multi vitamins as i heard that the high protien diet leaches calcium.
286-ian is not on atkins, but really just cut out most breads and definately pastas.
287-he is having a sandwhich at lunch for school, but that is the most grains he gets.
288-i will look into lo carb pastas, but i want him to get into the habit of complex carbs, such as beans and whole grains.
289-when we went to p.f.
290-changs (who by the way, has a whole side menu listing nutritional content) he ate about one quarter of the rice he was served.
291-i was proud.
292-as a society in general we shovel gobs and gobs of crap in our mouths daily and think nothing of it.
293-now that i'm eating right, i am feeling so much better, due entirely to my sugar levels regulating, but it feel somewhat like a miracle and i don't know why it took this long to reach this space.
294-i fear i have done minor damage that will rear its ugly head in 10 years and slam me to the ground.
295-all that means is live now.
296-because i cant stop that, i can only fix where i am.
297-my body is so forgiving to me tho (10 years of abuse, and 2 weeks im almost back to normal again) that i have high hopes of self regeneration.
298-getting to the gym has not yet happened.
299-I MUST DO THIS.
300-some one light a fire under my ass please.
301-extreme nausea.
302-i feel pukey.
303-was it that turkey bacon thingy?
304-my ketones?
305-I dont have rank breath so i dont think im ketone-y (too bad since that equals fat burning) but urgh.
306-blood is 86. again, very good blood stats today!
307-meds and a large salad with lettuce\tomato\avacado\celery\pepperoni\cuke and this little turkey mignon medallion thingy - about 7 carbs total.
308-wishbone carb solutions olive oil vinagrette is da bomb people.
309-i don't like waiting and i don't like when my  customers make me wait for no good reason.
310-i scheduled this service at his convenience and somehow hes in conference when i arrive, can some one else show me to the pc i need to fix?
311-noooooooo i must wait.
312-fuk em at 65 an hour, i'll wait.
313-the great news is my blood one hour after breakfast was 96. that rocks, i mean really rocks.
314-wow.
315-funny thing is, I dont feel light, i feel kinda bloated and i've had muscle soreness getting worse and worse by the day, my shoulder is really killing me.
316-poo  breakfast - lo carb waffle and 2eggs with cheese arb count 8.5  TA         
       carne asada and a big salad.
317-hansens kiwi strawberry soda (diet of course)         
       10 carbs later (about 90 min) my blood is 108. not bad.
318-Is very good.
319-or rather a very good compromise.
320-For anyone who has ever been to the northwoods in, or the boat, you'll know how delicious thier cheesy bread is.
321-spread generously over orowheat and broil.
322-DELICIOUS and only 6 carbs per serving.
323-total carbs today so far, less than 30         
       all the toppings of a costco combo pizza slice and half a polish sausage with mustard.. also one lo-carb klondyke bar (only 5 carbs and a little bit of heaven) sooooo.... took my lunchtime meds at about 1:30, ate at about 3:30,  total carbs, I'm going to give it a 12.           
       ok ok i know it's obsessive, but i checked my blood again when i finishd my service call, 82, so its gone down 17 points in one hour.
324-brave new world.
325-i feel light headed and shakey, sounds arelike i'm ina awell, felt  like this before i fainted(the one and only time) so i pulled over to check my sugars and i'm at 99?
326-wierd          
       waffle at 7:45 - then i had to dash, i'm going to make a salad now, don't know if i will have time for lunch.
327-ps.
328-except for dawson, dawson's creek still totally rocks my world.
329-also, lets hear it for giant salads - entire avacado, and various veggies - probably 10 carbs max         
       looking good, looking good.
330-and there is a way to incorporate more than one blog, it will just take some work.
331-alot of work.
332-I really need to think about getting a new domain and host.
333-i have a full freaking day of work ahead of me, so  blah it's a monday.
334-but i havent had my salad yet.
335-maybe I'll just go to sleep         
       just ate - lamb chops and salad with cheese, tomato, cuke, cilantro and pepperoni yum.
336-probably about 5 carbs.
337-Had a klondyke lo-carb bar after getting that 64 reading.. it only has three net carbs, but alot of these sweet treats have sugar alchohols, great for the diabetes, but no stored fat will burn until the sugar alcohols do.
338-still, I am feeling well in general and on the right track.
339-my shoulder has really been bothering me and I need to start therapy for this - apparently frozen shoulder is a symptom of diabetes.
340-and it hurts.
341-took my meds and I'm going in for another salad.
342-night         
       okay.
343-thats too low.
344-time to eat.
345-breakfast was late, 2 eggs, some corned beef hash and two lo carb waffles.
346-13 carbs total.
347-lunch - an avacado with 8 flax seed tortilla chips - 10 carbs total.
348-Oooh and some yummy grape k00l-aid.
349-yup I know this blog is boring, but its meant as a tracking diary, not track side entertainment, HOWEVER - I would like to revamp it a bit to somehow include - food diary, blood tracker, weight tracker.
350-what I dont want is to have to update the template every time.
351-but it would be nice to view it simply, on a side table - such as daily blood, daily carbs, weekly weight.
352-I love the simplicity of blogger and the fact that I can post from my pager, you must admit, is wicked cool.
353-I also need to take some mofugly pictures of me in a 'tard and tights or something, and update that weekly - eventually compile them into one animated gif - "the amazingly fine shrinking kitty"  mom and pop are proud of my progress (which really should have begun 10 years ago - but ni modo) and that makes me feel fine.
354-im such a needy kitty, requiring validation at every turn.
355-this is why I would make a splendid rock star.
356-Vh1 presents, "behind the kitty" HAH             
       14 day average 135 - looking good.
357-about one hour nad a half after ingesting at least 20 carbs, 11 of which were grains, my blood is 112, excellent as mr. burns would say, excellent         
       well.. got my butt out of bed and had some celery and spinach dip 3 carbs, a whole avacado 6 carbs and 2 low carb waffles 11 carbs  total today, about 24 carbs.
358-i feel okay tho, not fainty.

360-I had 3 deviled half eggs, a handful of almonds and prettymuch forced myself into a map/ its 3:15 and I pretty, much havent eaten anything today.
361-also.. if my moms scale is correct, i lost 9 pounds.
362-beej wants to go to the movies, but we've already seen potter.
363-what else is there??
364-aft blood 89!!!!
365-forgot to bring my pill box tho.
366-2 eggs and a whole avacado for breakfast 8 carbs and nothing since          
       hell yes again!
367-dont feel too bloaty.
368-but woke up in the middle of the night with horrendous cramps         
       at 330 today my blood was 99 and I had 2 protien burgers - 22 carb-os  taking my meds now, and going to eat in about 30 min, i shouldnt eat this late, i will be bloaty and stuff in the morning, and tho it will be lo carb and my total daily carbs should be under 60..          
       having a caca day, cant seem to get off the friggin phone, one thing after another and i am going to miss the hollywood calls          
       at 7:45 I ate a waffle - 5.5 carbs - and took my meds.
369-about an hour later i'm at 126 - i think thats pretty good         
       HELL YES!
370-:) took my meds about 9:30 last night.. but didnt eat after (ate before - steak and broccoli)  had a TJ waffle for breakfast.
371-so tasty, i cant believe its only 5.5 carbs.
372-aft blood 110   finally, somewhat normal, but i haven't eaten since 11 AM           
       four eggs con chorizo 4 carbs.
373-one lo-carb waffle 5.5 carbs, one cup lo-carb milk 3 carbs          
       this is ridiculous.
374-I had one low carb Trader Joes bluberry waffle - 5 carbs (supposedly) and two meds.
375-so what gives!
376-plus im hungry.
376-plus im hungry.
376-plus im hungry.
379-caca.
380-one day of cheating, a little cheating mind you....
381-I probably had about 150-200 carbs yesterday and I took all my meds.
382-when I think of how  i was eating just until a week ago.. i shudder.. i would take in, hmm.... 400-600 a day easy i'm sure.
383-and on days when i had a sweet tooth.
384-argh.
385-i feel like im going to explode.
386-i can't worry about whats done, its done.
387-but tis scary to think of the future.
388-ever vigilant.
389-if i can lose the weight, at least 50 pounds, then i beleive my sugars will react better.
390-hopefully the glucophage therapy will beat my ovaries into submission and assist.
391-but menopause approaches and its going to be a downhill battle.
392-not a good morning.
393-plus, someone bought my company.
394-I'll get the scoop at the 8am conference call.
395-at least its LA based, not dallas, perhaps they will be more sensative to our gas plight and jack up the milage.
396-4 hours later my blood sugar is 146 which is not good dammit.
397-never again          
       day 8 and i cheated.
398-and it was bad food!
399-i ordered stroganoff, lite noodles, but it was more like congealed beef stew over noodles?
400-i only had a few egg noodels, like less than 1/4 cup, but the meat tasted real flour-y and i had a small slice of banana bread.
401-50-80 carbs for this bullshit meal, and i will probably get tummy cramps to boot.
402-live and learn, should sprang for the t-bone!!
403-11 AM and i havent eaten anything, nor did i take my meds, blood sugar is 165 this means meds are key, food, not so much.
404-going to take meds and eat a big lunch now.
405-ta!
406-rock on.
407-took meds 14 hours ago, but did not eat after about 7:3 0or so.
408-woke up feeling very light.
409-urlLink Palm Store - Factory Outlet: palmOne Tungsten T3 Open Box Handheld  this is the one for me, 110$ discount for open box plus, join palm book club and get another 100 bucks off (but pay 10-15 bucks a month for one year) which is kinda like credit.... plus I get a free book once a month.

415-urlLink this is the baby I want   but its a shell out of 279 plus tax which I can ill afford and weight 2 months for the 150 back.
416-well of course the blogging honeymoon is over.
417-also I need to get a new domain, got paid today, will do this weekend.
418-create several blog in blogs, with carb and blood counters.
419-yahoootie!

36-A UK publication called eGov Monitor Weekly has reported that around 800 public sector Web sites may need rebuilding to comply with accessibility laws requiring government services to cater for people with disabilities.
37-The claim is based on details leaked from an internal report carried out by the Office of the e-Envoy (OeE), the cabinet office unit responsible among other things for improving the accessibility and usability of UK government Web sites.
38-The OeE report draws upon the findings by the National Audit Office investigation, which examined the accessibility of 65 central government Web sites and concluded that nearly all were potentially excluding users.
39-EGov Monitor estimates that to fix the problems, government departments may need to spend at least 10 percent to 15 percent of their total annual budget for Web sites.
40-Editor Ian Cuddy told ElectricNews.Net that it was difficult to put a precise figure on the total cost of the redesigns required because the OeE has refused to release further details of the audit, but it is expected to run into millions.
41-The OeE has now warned the Web design industry that future government contracts will demand that companies deliver Web sites that conform to international Web accessibility standards.
42-Current responsibility for adopting these standards rests with individual government webmasters, not designers, and compliance is not centrally monitored.

140-urlLink BBC article:    Opening hours row at cottage: The cottage was opened as a museum in 1924.
141-A heritage group in Stafford say they are angry at plans to cut the opening hours of one of the town's most historic landmarks despite their offers of help.
142-The borough council says Izaak Walton's Cottage, in Shallowford, is proving expensive to run.
143-The former home of Izaak Walton, the author of 1653 fishing book The Complete Angler, houses a collection dedicated to his life and angling.
144-A report to councillors says that limiting access to the museum to weekends from May to August would save 17,000.
145-Currently the attraction is open on weekday afternoons from April to October.
146-'Few opportunities' But the Izaak Walton Cottage Chapter, who have set up a charitable trust to fund the running of the cottage, said they were upset the council had not met them before making the decision.
147-Tony Bridgett, president of the chapter, said: "The council threatened to close the cottage 18 months ago and there was a campaign run by the people of Stafford and ourselves to keep it open.
148-"So in some respects we are delighted that it is staying open.
149-"But it is only going to open from May to the end of August, and only on Saturdays and Sundays and not bank holidays so members of the public are going to get very few opportunities to visit.
150-"We have some money available and the council say they haven't got any but they haven't got round to meeting us so we are able to mutually work together."
151-Members of the council's leisure scrutiny committee will debate the plans next week.
152-A spokeswoman for the council said the hours had been revised to take into account when visitors most used the cottage.
153-She said a range of events will continue to be held at the cottage and coach trips, including schools, would still be able to visit during the week.
154-SpaceShipOne, the first private manned spacecraft, is undergoing final preparations before its historic flight to the edge of space on Monday.
155-The craft, built by aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, will be launched into the sky by its carrier, White Knight, then rocket upwards to 100km (62 miles).
156-No private craft has ever been so high.
157-In May, it reached 64km (40 miles) in a test flight, doubling its last best.
158-The attempt over California's Mojave Desert is due to launch at 1330 GMT.
159-Mr Rutan and his team from his company, Scaled Composites, hope the flight will take them closer to winning the Ansari X-prize of $10m (5.7m) awarded to the first non-government, manned flight into space.

168-urlLink Google, Yahoo face off in suit   Google is the darling of the Internet and seemingly at the top of its game as it charges toward a public stock offering sometime this summer.
169-But the Mountain View company could be paying hundreds of millions of dollars to its Sunnyvale archrival, Yahoo, if it loses a little-noticed patent lawsuit unfolding in a San Jose courtroom.
170-The case pits Google against Overture Services, an Internet advertising company bought by Yahoo last year.
171-Overture claims it patented an online bidding system for ads seven months before Google introduced a similar system.
172-Patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit said Overture's patent claims can't be easily dismissed.
173-``I think there is merit based on the breadth of the claims,'' said Dave Ashby, a patent attorney with the IP Strategy Group in Cupertino.
174-``I took a look at it and said, `Yep, Google does that.
175-Yep, Google does that.'
176-''  A key ruling in the 2-year-old case -- which could determine whether the two sides settle or forge ahead to a jury trial -- is expected at any time, say patent attorneys who have reviewed the suit.
177-Advertising made up about 95 percent of Google's $1 billion in revenue last year.
178-If the company loses the patent suit, it would probably have to pay damages, license technology from Yahoo or alter how it manages its ad system.
179-Overture, then known as GoTo.com, filed its patent in May 1999 for a ``system and method for influencing a position on a search result list.''
180-The 43-page patent application details a system in which advertisers would be able to bid for better placement of ads in search-engine results and manage their accounts through a Web browser.
181-The U.S. Patent Office awarded the patent July 31, 2001.
182-In February 2002, Google introduced its AdWords program -- a system that would eventually help reshape Internet advertising and legitimize search engines as a viable business.
183-With AdWords, advertisers bid for the right to certain keywords.
184-When a Google user types in that keyword as part of a search, the advertiser's pitch shows up near the results.
185-A tour operator in Hawaii, for example, might buy the terms ``Hawaii,'' ``vacation,'' ``volcano'' and ``beach,'' and its ads will appear next to Google search results for those terms.
186-Advertisers bid against one another for keywords, with higher bidders getting better ad placement.
187-In its suit, filed in April 2002, Overture says Google is ``willfully'' and ``directly infringing'' on its patent.
188-The company is seeking triple damages.
189-Google, which is in a mandated ``quiet period'' leading up to its IPO, declined to comment on the suit, as did attorneys representing both companies.
190-But in court documents, the company denies Overture's allegations.
191-Among other things, Google is claiming that Overture was using its advertising system for more than a year before it filed for its patent.
192-Patent law gives people a year to file patents after inventing something; a late filing automatically invalidates the patent.
193-Patent attorneys who have reviewed court documents have mixed views on Overture's chances of prevailing.
194-Mitchell Rosenfeld, a patent attorney with Capstone Law Group in San Mateo, said Google has submitted substantial evidence to show that Overture missed the one-year deadline.
195-Rosenfeld said a key issue in the case could end up being whether Overture was testing its technology or using a finished product.
196-On the other hand, Overture needs only to prove that Google infringed on one of the 67 claims in its patent.
197-Also, Overture's patent application appears to have been well-researched by both the company and the patent office, said Bruce Sunstein of Bromberg  Sunstein in Boston.
198-``This is going to be a patent that is relatively difficult to knock out,'' Sunstein said.
199-Since late March, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, a former patent attorney, has been analyzing the scope and meaning of Overture's patent, poring over each word and studying terminology such as ``database'' and ``search result list.''
200-It's a crucial step before a jury can be asked to decide whether a company has infringed on a patent.
201-A ruling could come any day.
202-Known as ``Markman'' rulings, these decisions are often tipping points in patent cases, said patent attorney John Ferrell, co-founder of Carr  Ferrell in Palo Alto.
203-If the judge does not agree with one side's interpretation of the patent language, it will often push to settle the suit, he said.
204-The case is especially intriguing now that Internet search engines have become big business.
205-When the suit was filed two years ago, Overture was suing an up-and-coming search engine with an unproven business model.
206-Today, Google is considered the king of Internet search.
207-And Overture's stature increased when Yahoo acquired the company for $1.83 billion in stock and cash, incorporating its advertising technology and patents into its services.
208-``It's one of those things that two or three years ago wouldn't have been an issue,'' said Andy Beal, vice president of search marketing for WebSourced.
209-``But it just goes to show you how big search is.''
210-About half of all patent verdicts are overturned on appeal.
211-And the stakes are high.
212-Ultimately, the two sides will have to weigh the costs of a prolonged legal fight -- attorney bills in a case like this could reach $1 million a year -- against the possibility of losing.
213-``My observation is that there is this big lawsuit between two enormous players,'' Ashby said, ``and no one is paying attention to it.''

229-The All-party Parliamentary Internet Group (APIG) also recommended that a new offence be created to target cyber-criminals who try to shut websites.
230-Experts said the new law could be used against the extortion gang that attacked gambling websites, including those run by Blue Square and Capital Sports, in the run-up to Euro 2004.

0-           Well, I decided to start this site after some bad customer support experiences with  urlLink http://www.atkins.com  in their "My Atkins" area.
1-Their site is so slow and it's been impossible for me to upload my "before" photo to help me see my progress visually.
2-I figure it's probably better to have my own weight loss journal so that I can get exactly what I want out of it.
3-So,totell about my situation...
4-I'm 25 years old, and I've been trying to lose weight since May 2003.
5-My highest weight ever was 400 pounds.
6-I've lost 57 pounds so far and it's been quite a journey.
7-I've had all sorts of eating habits.. for several months I was vegetarian because I got sick from fatty foods after having gallbladder surgery.
8-My gallbladder was taken out in July 2003 after I'd lost about 30 pounds rather quickly from low calorie dieting.
9-My doctor who did that surgery said that the pain might return because after physically looking at the stuff he took out of me he just didn't think that the stones were causing the kind of pain that I felt.
10-I don't really regret having the surgery since those stones had to pass at some point.
11-My dad had a stone pass once and it got stuck in a duct and he had to be hospitalized for a while,it was a really traumatic experience.
12-I'm glad I'm not going to have to go through that.
13-On July 12 2004 I started the Atkins Nutritional Approach because of course that pain returned along with a lot of bowel symptoms.
14-I had read somewhere that eating low-carbohydrates can help ease the pain with some people who have Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
15-Boy were they right.
16-Every time I thought back to all the times I got sick while eating, it was always after eating a bowl of mashed potatoes or a bunch of bread.
17-I talked this over with a gastroenterologist and he gave me the information that I needed to make a life-change to my eating habits that will make me not feel so sick anymore.
18-He agrees that I most likely have Irritable Bowel Syndrome from discussing my history, dating all the way back to my childhood.
19-During the last month I've already had just about every other medical condition ruled out.
20-IBS can not be tested for.. it is a "functional" syndrome, meaning that there's no disease present, my body just works differently in a way that can be painful if I am not careful with the way that I eat.
21-So, I've been doing a sort of modified Atkins plan for one week, and I already feel 95% better.
22-I've lost 2 inches off my measurements already (wow!)
23-although the scale is playing games with my head.
24-That's probably due to all the water and that will come down with time as well.
25-I feel a little bit better every day.
26-Two weeks ago, I didn't want to get out of bed because of the excruciating abdominal pain.
27-Now I am able to live my life again.
28-Right now I'm doinga modified Atkins induction.
29-Thismeans less than net 20 carbs a day, except I'm eating extra fiber foods thaninduction allows, such as spinach and broccoli, and I'm takingmetamucil up to the recommended 25-30 grams of fiber a day.
30-First thing in the morning I have 36 ounces of water, split three ways, 2 doses of 17g Miralax (polyethylene glycol..
31-ewww!
32-), and the third 12 oz glass of water is my first metamucil of the day.
33-This morning routine is part of my bowel program given to me by my doctor last week.
34-If I dont follow the program the way that I do, I will get really, really sick just like I was before.
35-Besides, the vitamins from my fiber veggies are really good for me.
36-Speaking of vitamins, I take a One a Day Carb Smart in the afternoon right before lunch time.
37-The motivation not to eat some french fries or a piece of bread, is the constant knowledge that eliminating them from my diet is the only reason that I am not in pain anymore.
38-I track all of my food/exercise using Fitday PC which I bought at  urlLink http://www.fitday.com  .
39-They have a free version that you can track your stuff through their website, but I like the PC version better because it has a lot more flexibility and options.
40-Here are some links for articles about Atkins and IBS, explaining why I am feeling a lot better:    urlLink http://atkins.com/Archive/2002/1/11-771731.html      urlLink http://atkins.com/Archive/2002/2/12-234348.html0-17,April,2004

0-           "Being Twenty-Something"  They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis."
1-It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like.
2-You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.
3-You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones.
4-What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.
5-You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.
6-Your opinions have gotten stronger.
7-You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.
8-One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure.
9-You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life.
10-You feel alone and scared and confused.
11-Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.
12-You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you.
13-Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better.
14-Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.
15-One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap.
16-Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.
17-You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.
18-You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!
19-What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it.
20-We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.
21-Send this to your twenty something friends.... maybe it will help someone feel like they aren't alone in their state of confusion.....    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US!!
22-I can't help but think about the past.
23-The past I truely want to forget.
24-I just had my birthday a few days ago, and as I was talking to my friend about life in general, I realized that I am missing a major thing in my life.
25-A man.
26-What I mean is, I don't have a father, a boyfriend and or a close friend who is a guy.
27-I used to.
28-But my father passed away a few years ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of three years and me  my best guy friend  aren't as close as we used to be.
29-Is there something wrong with that?
30-I need to get away.
31-I don't know what it is, i can't stay here anymore.
32-I'm gone.
33-I not might sure what's going on right now in my life.
34-But what I'm sure about is that life is getting even more crazy as the day goes by.
35-For example, last week, Jason's uncle called me.
36-I bet your asking yourself, why is his uncle calling me right?
37-Well, he called to tell me that he likes me!
38-I know it sounds really strange but I thought he was joking or something but he wasn't.
39-He also told me something that I would never get over.
40-Jason has a two year old son and his married.
41-The worst part is, Jason was married the past few years!
42-I can't believe he would do that.
43-I must be blind not to have noticed anything....
44-So much for my happy ending  Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did?
45-Was it something You said?
46-Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high  On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you?
47-All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  It's nice to know you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  So much for my happy ending0-28,July,2004

11-Thanks to Shari's deft handling of getting the Genkai 1 alliance goingon Friday/Saturday, our genkai experience was only mildly horrible instead of as excruciatingly horrible as it could have been.
12-On Friday, starting out with an alliance of 10 people that would eventually grow to 12 and then shrink back to five as the night went on, we managed to obtain 7/8 of the needed Exoray Molds in a mere 5 hours.During this time we somehow  (read: I blame everything on Dynastey) managed to aggro nearly everything in the nest at least once,and in the case of WaterElementals- two or three times.
13-Saturday turned out better.On our trek to Eldeime Dyn only managed to aggro half of the mobs in the glacier -- A personal best!
14-Even with a smaller group than the night before, we were still able to dispatch anything that came our way.
15-In a mere four hours we were rewarded with 4/8 papyrus and only one death and level down.
16-It was just Shari, so it wasn't so bad.

65-This first post merely introduces this blog, which will be used for scheduling and information for the FFXI Lakshmi Server Swashbucklers Linkshell and Static Party.
66-Shari and Skellington have put this together for the purposes of acting like pirates, leveling, and generally having a good time.
67-BCNM and party schedules to follow.
68-Thanks.
69--Shari    
       Gang, we will return you to our regularly scheduled program of XPing!
70-Every night but Tues and Thurs this week at 10 in Jeuno!
71-One exception is we might have to do a makeup genkai run.
72-This would pre-empt the XPing on one of said nights.

0-           I wish I was back in high school for this one:   urlLink Wireless Networking for the TI graphing calculators .
1-Back in high school, our graphing calculators full of games saved some of our sanity.
2-We went so far as to create Tetris tournaments.
3-I went so far as to create games in BASIC for the TI-85, then to learn assembly for the TI-92.
4-I never did get enough knowledge of the TI-92 to create games, but that knowledge did help me out with my college course in assembly.
5-urlLink Mac OS 9 versus Corel Linux ?
6-At first, this "Death Match" made no sense at all.
7-After reading the article, it still makes no sense at all but did a good job of explaining the abilities of these  alternative  OSs.
8-Have they found out the  urlLink mechanism for memory ?
9-I can smell her now.
10-The scent is reminiscent of a powder.
11-Not baby powder, but a dry, mute aroma.
12-A floral accent is present, similar to lilacs yet not as pungent.
13-Before this, I only had one visual.
14-The setting is always the same.
15-Nighttime turns red to grey and yellow to white.
16-She stands softly with her back to a wall of windows, covered mostly with draperies.
17-It seems to be our bedroom.
18-The visual of her is the strongest.
19-Long, straight hair frames her oval face, giving her an intelligent air.
20-The color black is an understatement, for her raven hair is so dark it is translucent.
21-The contrast to her pale skin is remarkable.
22-Though barely visible in the moonlight, her eyes burn with a comfortable evil.
23-She is definitely my equal.
24-Her attire is still a bit hazy.
25-The Japanese aspects of my psyche scream out kimono, yet it could just be a simple shapeless dress she is wearing.
26-The setting speaks that we are home for the night, or we could have just gotten home.
27-There are many things I know, yet questions still remain.
28-Her emotion toward me has two possibilities; she is either upset and concerned about something between us, or she has a joy in her heart boundless.
29-The year I turn 22 is pivotal, but is it because we meet this year, or because we get married in that year?
30-These images and soothsay swirl in my mind as a mist, never to be grasped.
31-To counteract my actions of snobbery, my monitor decided that it really really liked Yellow.
32-Trying to view the net in shades of yellow will kill your eyesight for at least an hour for every 5 minutes of surfing.
33-It was a nice flat screen 17 inch NEC, but I got it used without a warranty.
34-$350 will disappear from my wallet soon.
35-I am currently using a 14'' POS, and 14 inches is not enough to satisfy.
36-Sent by Jamie (no surprise there...)PICK UP LINES THAT MAY GET YOU HURT1 If you and I were squirrels, could I bust a nut in your hole?2 I'd like to wrap your legs around my head and wear you like a feed bag.3 If it's true that we are what we eat, I could be you by morning!4 How do you like your eggs: poached, scrambled, or fertilized?5 I was about to go masturbate and I needed a name to go with your face.6 You are so fine that I'd eat your shit just to see where it came from.7 My love for you is like diarrhea, I just can't hold it in.8 Roses are red.
37-Violets are blue.
38-I like spaghetti.
39-Let's go f**k.9 Is that a keg in your pants?
40-'Cause I would love to tap that ass!10 If your right leg was Thanksgiving, and your left leg was Christmas, could I meet you between the holidays?11 You remind me of a championship bass, I don't know whether to mount you or eat you!12 Your parents must be retarded, because you are special.13 Could I touch your belly button .
41-.
41-.
43-from the inside?14 I'm not too good at algebra, but doesn't U+I = 69?15 How about we play lion and lion tamer?
44-You hold your mouth open, and I'll give you the meat.
45-I have waited this long to blog  urlLink Sluggy Freelance  because it took me about a week to read all of the archives.
46-Some of the jokes get old after awhile, but the concept is great!
47-Last season was the first time I truly watched The Real World.
48-It was a great season, and  urlLink next season  seems to have great promise.
49-Even though Jamie insists that this technology already exists, I think the development of  urlLink instant water purification  is facinating.
50-This is very promising, if not utterly amazing.
51-urlLink Light can be accelerated to almost 300 times  c  .
52-The following concerns a question in a physics degree exam at the University of Copenhagen:"Describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer.
53-"One student replied:"You tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer, then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground.
54-The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.
55-"This highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed immediately.
56-The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.The arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did not display any noticeable knowledge of physics.
57-To resolve the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.For five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought.
58-The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use.
59-On being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:"Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground.
60-The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared.
61-But bad luck on the barometer.
62-""Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow.
63-Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.
64-""But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper.
65-The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqrroot (l / g).
66-""Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.
67-""If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.
68-""But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper'.
69-"The student was Niels Bohr, the only Dane to win the Nobel prize for Physics.
70-The more I work at the Student Publications building, the closer I come to having this be my future:  urlLink Who Wants to Marry a Sysadmin?
71-If you are not into at least one flavor of UNIX, this will make no sense.
72-urlLink PSone, the portable Sony Playstation .
73-Even though they say that you must plug the system into a regular electrical outlet, you know someone is going to make a fat battery pack.
74-Maybe even a base that will fit just underneath the PSone.
75-A giant development in the world of cybernetics has occured.
76-The  urlLink first true cyborg  has been created.
77-Based on a  urlLink wheeled robot design  (looks like a robobiscuit), but controlled by a few neurons from an eel, the cyborg can follow or flee light and move in a circle.
78-This does not seem like much, but the implications are astounding.
79-The word of the day is  conduit .
80-Why?
81-It sounds cool.Conduit: conduit (n.)  A means by which something is transmittedThe word of the day is used in the song Get Off by Bad Religion:Lascivious, it's all that I can think of as I drag my feet, searching like a diogenes,dangerous, the adjectives of the decade and of your alluring intricacies,I can see your green-screen mentality and I can feel the sting of it's consequence,and I know I shouldn't but it's too much to ignore, an emotion I deplore,every time I look at you,I just want do it,I can clench my fist right through itbut I just want to get offrectilinear, this direction we've been headingnever realizing we are on a runaway machine,angular, the momentum that does turn us onestep further on our ladder,one more turn toward the east,I realize your green-screen mentalityand I know it is shared by many more,I know it's quite impossible but I am damned to find a way to revolve the other way,every time I scrutinize I just say "screw it",we're on a ride down a blind  conduit  and I just want to get off

389-Knowing that the file server uses Appletalk as the protocol and TCP/IP is used for everything else, we narrowed down the list of possible problems.
390-Checking out the error logs on our servers showed stuff like this over and over and over: Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 141.211.148.76 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 10.0.1.5 from 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 Aug 16 18:54:45 beer.pub.umich.edu dhcpd: DHCPNAK on 10.0.1.5 to 00:50:e4:30:6f:24 via eth1 In basic terms, this is what was happening:  a system comes online and tries to DISCOVER the DHCP server, the server OFFERs a good IP from it's pool, the client REQUESTed a bad IP, and the server does Not AcKnowledge that request.
391-Then the cycle repeats.
392-This made no sense to all three of us working on the problem.
393-We tried restarting our DHCP server, we tried using a different server, etc etc.
394-FINALLY, Sat realized that someone had an  urlLink Apple AirPort  they wanted to hook up.
395-Searching the  urlLink Apple Tech Info Library , we found out that the AirPort acts as a DHCP server!
396-It was accepting all of the requests, and just giving out bad information!
397-Took that off the network, and everything returned to normal.
398-And it only took 8 hours to figure that out.
399-In the midst of a vast wilderness, far off, standing all alone, is a high mountain.

406-I used to joke about how my main non-free ISP was AOL (simply because a family member has paid for it, and I get an account), yet my main operating system has become some flavor of UNIX.
407-I thought I would never see this day, but there is now an  urlLink AOL client for Linux .
408-I cannot try it out, simply because I only have a winmodem that doesn't work in Linux, but we shall see when I get that cable modem...

411-When I read that  urlLink Famke Janssen was learning to lap dance  for a new film, I didn't pay much attention.
412-Later in the day when I realized that  urlLink Janssen  played Dr. Jean Grey in the X Men movie, my thoughts fully changed.
413-She is one of under 5 women in the public eye (read: celebrities) that I find attractive.
414-The others include Natalie Portman and Christy Turlington.
415-The best part of  urlLink this article about cloning the Tazmanian tiger : A far more emotional debate rages over the plan to reincarnate the tiger through cloning.
416-Archer has crossed angry picket lines at his museum, and his work has been denounced by religious groups who accuse the scientists of playing God.

421-It feels weird that I no longer have an  urlLink AOL  account.
422-Even though I have had much better ways to connect over the past two years (think LAN connected to a T1), the lack of the ability to hop on AOL is overwhelming.
423-No longer can I check the profiles of friends, no longer can I...    wait, I guess all I ever used AOL for was to check profiles.
424-I just need to 'borrow' an account from someone every once in awhile, and all will be good.
425-I remember discussing the futility of regrowing neurons in my Neurobiology class first semester of my sophomore year.
426-It was decided that even if new cells could be transplanted and they would grow, the neural net would be so complex that the cells would never fully integrate themselves.
427-The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania has made an attempt at this experiment.
428-The  urlLink results  show that the neurons helped stroke victims regain motor control.
429-A very promising step indeed.

458-Mark: I'm sorry.
459-I can in no way say that this represents the interests of my client.
460-Bruce: It's a standard itinerary, Gerald--dinner, dancing, and [mumbles into his hand] intercourse.
461-Mark: [abruptly] I beg your pardon?
462-Bruce: [confident] Dinner, dancing, and intercourse.
463-Mark: You mean a quick *hump*, don't you Gerald?!

466-Children come in here!
467-Mark: "Dinner, dancing, and intercourse"--what do you think my client is, huh?
468-A 90-dollar-an-evening hooker?
469-Bruce: This is dinner at the *Plaza*, Gerald.
470-Mark: Oh really?!
471-So, she's a 120-dollar-an-evening hooker, is that it?
472-Bruce: Well, at least a hooker comes across.
473-[pause] I can't believe I said that.
474-Mark: Gerald, do I sense that, uh, your client has certain feelings for my client?
475-Bruce: My client makes 62,000 dollars a year.

480-Bruce: Yes!
481-No!
482-He's not sure.
483-[pause] Back off Gerald!
484-Mark: I'll back off, but perhaps now you'd be willing to take a look at the proposal my client is making to your client.
485-Bruce: [big sigh] [Mark opens up his briefcase and drops a folder containing a thick stack of papers onto the desk.
486-Bruce opens the folder and flips through a few pages without really looking anything.]
487-Bruce: You forgot one thing, Gerald.
488-Mark: What's that?
489-Bruce: The actual date of the wedding and the color of the bridesmaids' gowns!Mark: Come off it Gerald.
490-It's a standard 17-week dating commitment.
491-All my client wants to do is to get to know your client.
492-Bruce: Hey, all my client wants to do is get to know your client.

496-Let's just look at her roster of ex-boyfriends.

498-Bruce: [realizes his error and gently closes the drawer.]
499-The Doobie Brothers??
500-[pause] Mark: All right, perhaps we were a little hasty with the 17-week dating commitment.
501-Perhaps we can accommodate the obvious interests of your client a bit more.
502-How about this: a six date schedule with possible sexual intercourse on date six.
503-Bruce: Gerald, I'm no longer interested in this "possible sexual intercourse" you keep selling me on.
504-Last time, it turned out to be a cheap handjob at the drive in.
505-Mark: Your client ejaculated, Gerald!
506-Bruce: Sadly.
507-Very sadly.

524-.Guh.
525-Why don't we forget the guaranteed sexual intercourse clause.
526-Mark: Okay.
527-Bruce: Why don't we let nature take it's course.
528-Mark: Fine!
529-Bruce: You know the good old fashioned way?
530-Mark: [eagerly] Yeah, okay.
531-Bruce: A one date schedule with a guarantee that your client will consume 27-ounces of gin on that evening.
532-Mark: Come off it Gerald!
533-That's panty peeler and you know it.
534-Bruce: Call it what you will, it's a tool of the trade.
535-Mark: Sorry Gerald.
536-C'mon, she only weighs 105 pounds, for God's sake.
537-Bruce: I believe she weighs 111 pounds, Gerald.
538-Mark: In shoes!
539-[pause] All right.
540-I can't see letting her drink more than 8-ounces of gin.
541-Bruce: Jeez, I think she can drink, uh, 14-ounces of gin.
542-Mark: Maybe 10, maybe 10.
543-Bruce: I think she could scarf down 12-ounces of gin.
544-Mark: 11-ounces of gin.
545-Bruce: 12-ounces of gin on an empty stomach.
546-Mark: 11 on an empty stomach.

666-The last incarnation of this system had partitions setup for Windows 98, Windows 2000, linux, a linux swap file and a FAT32 data partition (MP3s, thanks).
667-No matter how hard I tried, I could only boot into linux using a boot disk.
668-The Windows 2000 bootloader was not smart enough to load it.
669-Originally, I had  urlLink Red Hat 6.2 installed .
670-Feeling adventurous, I decided to install  urlLink CAEN linux  instead.
671-Who wouldn't want to run a distribution of linux created at their  urlLink own university ?!
672-For some odd reason, CAEN tried to use my network card at IRQ 0, which just does not work.
673-Also, since it is based on Red Hat 6.1, it did not properly recognize my GeForce video card.
674-Screw that, time to go back to Red Hat 6.2.

684-Linux.
685-WTF?!

695-Let's start from the most recent and work our way back...   Today was my first discussion section for CS 280 (C++ programming).
696-We went over the mysteries that are FTP, telnet, pico, and the g++ compiler.
697-Aside to that obvious sarcasm, the GSI (graduate student instructor (read: TA)) is quite foreign, and impossible to understand.
698-No longer will my prescence be necessary at that class.
699-During 280 lecture yesterday, I sat beside an overly stressed sorority girl.
700-The stereotype was in full effect, as she complained about how she had no time for programming since it was rush week and she had to party.
701-She also complained about the complexity of UNIX.
702-All she has to do was type three well-documented commands.
703-We are even allowed to use Visual C++ for most of the work!
704-Dumb blonde.
705-Two nights ago was scary.
706-The main server at The Michigan Daily went down.
707-All of the stories, production templates, everything.

709-Logged in at the console, and it turns out that all 4 of the data hard drives had crashed, destroyed their disklabels, and could not be accessed with AppleTalk.
710-After an hour of scratching my head as to what would cause the 4 data drives to crash all at once, yet keep the operating system drive intact, we decided to blame the weather.
711-"Lightning", we told all of the frustrated Daily staff.
712-Oddly enough, even without disklabels, the drives randomly came back up for an hour.
713-Down for 2 more hours, and now they have been up for 48.
714-Stability, not my concern.
715-Other than that, life has been boring....    Everyone needs to  urlLink tell me what makes their life interesting .

726-It's buried near the bottom, so keep reading.
727-That place is a strip mall of 100,000 people, 98% of which are white.
728-The city is not worthy of mention.
729-Here it is, 9:15 AM or so.
730-If I was going to see Phish this weekend, I would have left by now.
731-You can just hear my spirits deflate.
732-Whoa, I just realized that I am going to Chicago for the weekend.
733-This has been planned since my birthday (August 4th -- don't forget next year!)

735-It will be a fun fun weekend, believe me.

741-Stolen, again, from  urlLink X-E .
742-Christopher Reeve broke his leg on August 17th during physical therapy.

749-Learn about PHP, Perl, Apache, etc.
750-I love this stuff!
751-What the hell?
752-My keyboard just died.
753-I thought maybe it was the AT --> PS/2 converter I was using, but a replacement did not improve the situation.
754-Then I thought maybe it was the port on my motherboard.
755-I found a PS/2 -- > USB converter and tried that.
756-I 'borrowed' a roommate's keyboard, and that worked just fine.
757-Feeling quite pissed off (do you have any idea how hard it is to use a computer without a keyboard?
758-), I took the old keyboard and shook it around a bit.
759-The power of fear made it work again.
760-Now I can get back to my regular life.
761-Yes,  urlLink Redhat Linux 7.0  is out, but when will we be able to download it?
762-The  urlLink FTP site  has been so bogged down that not even the mirror sites can download the necessary files.
763-Even the  urlLink support site  that only paying customers can access is busy!
764-I have successfully connected to one mirror site that had RH 7.0, but the did not have the CD image files (ISOs) that I wanted.
765-99% of older Linux distributions fail in some way on my hardware, so I figured there would be hope with the most brand new version.
766-When will I get to find out?!

769-The ongoing saga of standardized IM protocol:  urlLink ZDNet: News: AOL quietly linking AIM, ICQ .
770-Heh, I was just kidding, folks.
771-I did end up going to see Phish!The lot crowd before the show was a bit melancholy, which was most definitely caused by the combination of planes roaring directly overhead every two minutes and the slight amount of rain.
772-Once everyone got inside, the mood was dramatically lifted, mostly because we were no longer cold and wet.
773-Here is the setlist:Set I (0:53): Come On Baby Lets Go Downtown > Moma Dance, Frankenstein, Halley's Comet > Fee, Stash Set II (1:12): Birds of a Feather, Tweezer> NICU > Scent of a Mule, Fast Enough for You, Piper > Character Zer0 Encore (0:09): Sleeping Monkey > Tweezer RepriseShort first set, eh?
774-The reason: GLOWSTICKS.
775-People throwing hundreds of glow sticks all over the arena is a cool effect in the dark smoke-saturated environment.
776-People throwing glow sticks at  the stage , at   the band   -- not good.
777-We probably missed out on two songs because of it.
778-Most people knew something was wrong at intermission.
779-The arena crowd created a cacophony after the second set which was probably the ONLY reason why Phish did an encore.
780-The crowd really did not deserve it.
781-Thus, we got two songs, and the band bowed and ran off stage.
782-Dodging glowsticks.
783-Again.
784-Bastard phans.
785-This makes me oddly depressed.
786-The mere idea that the  urlLink X-33 will not fly  is troubling.
787-Mostly, because of the Mars Lander fiasco, NASA is not seen in the brightest of lights anymore.
788-The delays in developing the X-33 are mostly safety based (which makes sense if anyone remembers a  urlLink slight problem  in 1986 with the Challenger...), but these delays are not giving NASA credibility.
789-They need one project to work, and to work  well .
790-The International Space Station is still in development, and can't save them yet...
791-The Simpsons has been a favorite TV show for most geeks for over 10 years.

804-The  urlLink Espresso PC  is about the size of a large graphing calculator.
805-I would be afraid of losing that thing.
806-The cost is prohibitive since it uses mostly notebook parts.
807-Less expensive (but much larger) is the  urlLink BookPC .
808-This uses normal PC parts in a footprint about the size of a phonebook.
809-Neither of these systems are very upgradeable (Cannot upgrade anything on the Espresso, cannot put any new cards into the Book), but neither is the very popular  urlLink iMac !
810-Got to install one of the new DV models yesterday, and it could not be much easier.
811-Michigan State (3-3) at (16) Michigan (5-2) Player to Watch: Ryan Van Dyke, QB, Michigan State.
812-Starter has struggled since returning from injury and even got replaced last week by Jeff Smoker.
813-Breakdown: Both sides are issuing the standard spin about this being a tough rivalry game, but reality says it's a mismatch.
814-Despite their 3-0 start, the Spartans clearly are in a rebuilding year following a 10-2 campaign in 1999.
815-The only consistency is RB T.J. Duckett, the nation's No.
816-5 rusher (148.3 yards).
817-Michigan exploded in a 58-0 win last week and will likely go right at the Spartans' wobbly defensive front with powerful RB Anthony Thomas.

819-Lets try this a third time!

821-They shared articles rippping into each other:  The Daily published this  urlLink rebuttal  to the  urlLink Erin McQuinn article from October 10th .
822-Snews published  urlLink this article putting down Spartan tradition .
823-In contrast, Snews also  urlLink created a beautiful image of Ann Arbor and the culture , comparing it to a small European city.
824-An odd assortment for the last day of publishing before the Big Game....         
           Damnit!
825-Lost a huge post.
826-Well, that just sucked.

836-The big decision looms:  Do I stick with crappy IDE hardware, or do I start to upgrade to SCSI?
837-The new  urlLink PleXWriter PX-W1210S  cd burner is 12x/10x/32x and SCSI.
838-The IDE version of the same has been a top drive for some time.
839-With SCSI, upgrading is easy.
840-With IDE, the price is actually reasonable.
841-Plextor IDE: $250.
842-Plextor SCSI:  $380 .
843-That just made up my mind.
844-Optobionics is sitting on the  urlLink results of their retinal implant trials .
845-Could it be, gasp, because they failed?
846-urlLink Brain Size In Premature Infants Significantly Smaller Than Full-Term Babies ...   isn't that a well-known fact?
847-The braincase of humans is so large at full development that females would have to be structured very differently to give birth.
848-Instead, the brain and braincase increase in size  after birth .
849-Of course the brain is going to be one of the last things to fully develop, and thus premature babies will have smaller brains.
850-I guess it is working.

867-The oil supply is steady now, but it is estimated that with our current rate of extraction, that supply will be nil in 25 years.
868-Coal reserves can stretch out for 5 years beyond that, and then our fossil fuels are gone.
869-As of 1998, 89% of the energy of the world was produced from fossil fuels.
870-Alternative energy sources are less efficient, such as nuclear energy.
871-Future energy sources need to be developed.
872-urlLink Fusion  would be an excellent development, since power output is almost 10 times the power input.

874-With a headline like  urlLink Scientists Learn To Program Human Dreams , you would think this was a great accomplishment.

881-The first few were because of that gigantic thumb I lived under; I called it "Parental Guidance".
882-During that middle period, I missed the shows because the album they were touring for frankly sucked.
883-Fast forward to 2000, the May release of   urlLink The New America   and I started to get excited with the band again.
884-Preliminary reports of this tour got me even more excited since they were playing mostly older songs (read:  good songs)!

894-The pro-lifers are vying to have the House of Lords rule on this matter since it is along the lines of abortion.
895-Their idea is that the House of Lords would either postpone or oppose the seperation.Here is the kicker:  if the two are not seperated, they will both die within months.Here is the broad generalization: Pro-lifers are complete idiots.

921-The idea that  urlLink Apple is moving toward x86 hardware  is old.
922-Most people do not realize that even if they did move toward x86, you would not be able to just grab a Mac OS X CD, format your Windows box, and install freely.
923-Parts of the x86 hardware are going to be proprietary, at least at first.
924-Specific hardware will be supported to get the x86 platform started, then full support may roll in if the idea takes off.
925-Sega is about to stop producing hardware of all types, but as a final hurrah they may produce a  urlLink PCI card for PCs to play Dreamcast games .

1057-I love the fact that Americans will try to make money off  urlLink anything ...
1058-Thanks to  urlLink Zig  for that one.
1059-Not sure who is the original source of this:so i'm waiting for the bus at cc little to go to north campus, and this girl walks up and stands next to me.
1060-she's hot, by the way, and she's wearing a tri-delt sweatshirt.
1061-after i was done thinking about how hot she was, i realize that she's an idiot because i'm wearing my winter fucking coat and am still cold and she's standing outside waiting for a bus in nothing more than a sweatshirt.
1062-well, i've probably never been more right about anything in my life.so right when the bus is coming up she sees one of her friends - had to be in a sorority if not tridelt due to the black fuck me pants, black down north face jacket, black wool hat and black framed glasses.
1063-she also had black sandals on - yes, it was still cold outside.as i get on the bus, they sit down in front of me, which was nice, because remember, they're both hot.
1064-i'm not really paying attention to anything in particular, mostly because i'm contemplating how much it sucks that i'm going to north campus to sit in a class that i don't really need to be going to anyway, and so it catches me off guard a bit when i realize what the two girls in front of me are talking about.
1065-hard boiled eggs.
1066-it was just weird, that's all.so anyway, i'm listening to the girl in black bitch about how her roommate will hard boil all of the eggs in the fridge to use on salads at once, and then keep them in the egg carton so that when she wants to use an egg (god only know for what purpose - it certainly wasn't to eat, unless she was planning on inducing vomiting afterwards) she cracks it open only to find that it's hard boiled and not a raw egg.
1067-well this is where it starts to get entertaining for all of the engineers on the bus.
1068-now, it was just about 1 o'clock when i was on the bus, so there were a lot of non-engineering students just headed back to bursley after class, and thus only about half the bus was keeping an eye on the hot chicks - you see, engineers don't come across girls much, and when we encounter hot chicks we tend to just kind of stare at them.
1069-well, anyway, remember the girl in black was talking about all of the hard boiled eggs.so, the girl in the sweatshirt says, rather loudly, "well, why don't you just unboil them?
1070-"now, remember we on the bus that are paying attention are all engineers.
1071-i had already figured out that this girl was an idiot (sweatshirt in the cold), but the rest of the engineers must have been too engrossed staring at her to think much of that, so when she says the line about unboiling the eggs, one engineer just about chokes on his jimmy john's while the others stares turn from awe to amazement and shock at her stupidity - it really was funny.so the girl in black actually notices everyone staring at them at this point, and gets a little bit freaked out.
1072-she says something like, "what the fuck are you talking about, you can't unboil an egg", to which dumb sweatshirt girl says, sure you can, my boyfriend told me all about it.and i'll spare you the story, but it basically involved a practical joke that her boyfriend had played on her which resulted in her cracking a raw egg on her forehead.
1073-by now, most of the people on the bus, even the non-engineers, are trying to contain their laughter.
1074-i really can't, and i'm pretty much laughing out loud, but only the girl in black notices.and she gets pissed - either at the sweatshirt girl, or at everyone laughing at her, i don't know - and starts YELLING, "YOU CANT UNBOIL AN EGG".
1075-each time she yells it, sweatshirt girl starts getting bitchier and bitchier, yelling "YES YOU CAN".
1076-finally, the dude in front of them turns around, looks sweatshirt girl in the eye and says "you're crazy, you can't unboil an egg".
1077-this shut her up at least, and the north face girl looks really happy at being validated - i think that during the whole argument she wasn't really sure herself that you couldn't unboil an egg.so the sweatshirt girl just sits there for a minute, and then i can hear her mumbling under her breath something about "chemicals" and "her boyfriend" and she finally tells the northface girl that "i'm sure you can somehow.
1078-"northface girl of course just yells "NO YOU CANT".by now, most of the engineers have slapped their foreheads and left their hands there, making a pretty funny scene - a whole bunch of dorky guys holding their hands to their heads while shaking them.the girls talked about it for a while, and finally sweatshirt girl agreed that maybe you couldn't unboil an egg.
1079-by now, the rest of the bus was talking about it, and from the front, we could all hear a flaming homosexual music major ask, in the loudest, gayest voice possible, "Well, why *couldn't* you unboil an egg", which caused me and just about everyone else to go into convulsions of laughter all over again.by now, we had just about reached the stop, but stupid sweatshirt girl wasn't done yet.
1080-she had started talking about how it was tuesday, and tomorrow was wednesday, and how we should change the calendar so that wednesday was the first day in the week and tuesday was the last, so that we would have the weekend in the middle of the week.one of the engineers to our right had had enough i guess, and interrupted the two girls to inform them that if you put the weekend in the middle of the week, it would no longer be a weekend, it would be a weekmiddle.neither girl understood it, and while he tried to explain for a bit, we all ended up getting off the bus before he had a chance to finish.
1081-urlLink Version 6.0, LIVE .
1082-Coming next, a PHP/SQL driven site.
1083-Server upgrade complete!
1084-The downtime wasn't so much for the extra 128 megs of RAM I installed, but more so that I can undo the overclocking...   Unix is much better at making use of a CPU than any form of Windows.
1085-That Celeron 366 overclocked to 550MHz without problem on my old Windows 2000 machine.
1086-During certain activities (mostly compiling), the computer (the same CPU now in my OpenBSD machine) would completely freeze.
1087-This is not normal for Unix, so it must be the overclocking.
1088-Running comfortably at 366MHz, the machine should be 100% stable.
1089-To all 5 of you that read this site:  The site will be going down again for an upgrade (hardware this time) at 8:00 PM EST.
1090-Expected downtime will be less than one hour.
1091-Thank you.
1092-Woohoo!
1093-There might be a chance that  urlLink artritis can be controlled !
1094-urlLink Family Circus.
1095-Crazy Axe Murderer .
1096-Why Mike has stopped going to class:  More online comics:  urlLink Sinfest .
1097-The MP3 of the week has been updated.
1098-urlLink Radiohead  released Kid A awhile ago, and it is a radical departure from the glory that is OK Computer.
1099-Most of the songs grow on you, and I absolutely adore Optimistic.
1100-The background vocals are melodic (and blend in perfectly with the simplistic guitar riffs), the main vocals are crisp, and there are enough hooks for everyone to love this song.
1101-Not sure if this is radio-single-style quality, but it's quality nonetheless.
1102-The lyrics have a perfect sense of sardonicism (yes, that is a word, go look it up, MOFO):  You can try the best you canIf you try the best you canThe best you can is good enoughThis one's optimisticThis one went to marketThis one just came out of the swampThis one dropped a payloadFodder for the animalsLiving on an animal farm          
           I will definitely agree with this list:  urlLink The 50 Greatest Moments in Simpsons History .
1103-Too bad there are about 5 of those scenes that I have never seen!
1104-How is that possible?
1105-*SPANKED*   That is all there is to it.
1106-Java final: spank.
1107-Anatomy lab practical final: spank.
1108-Neither of those exams went well, to say the least.
1109-To make matters worse, the exams were set back to back:  Java final from 6-8pm, Anatomy lab final from 8-9pm.
1110-The fact that the exams were 2 miles apart also caused a problem.
1111-Add in the "snow" factor, the "buses running late" factor, and the "my ride never showed up" factor, and you have a cold, late Mikey.
1112-I got to the lab practical just in time to start, without instruction.
1113-Luckily the lab format was "here is a hacked up animal-like thing; what is this inordinately small object inside the carcass?"
1114-or "don't tell us what *that* object is, but tell us what it is related to in this other hacked up carcass".
1115-Hey, all that matters is that I am done.

1117-In my neverending quest for glory, I have decided to learn PHP and MySQL.
1118-Looking for more advanced tutorials for PHP led me to  urlLink Webmonkey  and what is probably  urlLink the worst tutorial ever written .
1119-Good job, guys!
1120-So my semester is over and I just want to be anti-social for awhile.
1121-I try to play some  urlLink Diablo II  and  urlLink Battle.net  is being a bitch.
1122-Wrestling and female explotation:  urlLink WOW .
1123-They try to cater to the 2% female audience, but fail miserably.
1124-Most of the audience was supporting  urlLink Slam Dunk , don't ask me why.
1125-Other than the requisite butch wrestlers with actual strength and no attractve qualities whatsoever, Slam Dunk was one of the least attractive.
1126-The rest of the wrestlers are there just for males to see lots of tight outfits and crazy positions.
1127-Lovely.
1128-Having taken both a chordate anatomy class and an evolution class, this  urlLink article about an aquatic origin for humans  is quite intriguing.
1129-Many of the adaptations shown by humans could be explained by certain aspects of an aquatic life.
1130-The examples they give are not in depth enough to be convincing though.
1131-This is just an article from a popular scientific magazine, and thus hardcore facts are avoided.
1132-Also, it seems that the researchers are jumping to conclusions.
1133-Yes, brain size and posture could be explained by this theory.
1134-The main problem is that there are no other concrete facts that support this idea, such as a fossil record that shows evolution of these traits.
1135-Why uncontrolled, mentally-impared people are a bane to existence:  urlLink Killer's motive?
1136-It was 'funny' .
1137-Oh man.

1140-Yeah, so it's been 8 days since I have posted.
1141-I am a busy boy!
1142-One more final (Chordate Anatomy and Phylogeny) and one more website (www.michigandaily.com) and then I can relax.
1143-Mwahahaha....
1144-The new MD.com is coming along quite nicely.
1145-BTW, I am back in Ann Arbor.
1146-Christmas was a good change of pace, but now I have to get back to work.
1147-The new switch I got for my home network has already proved quite valuable, since transfer rates from my main production computer to my main server have increased from 5kbps to 42kbps.
1148-Still not sure why two computers seperated by 3 feet and a switch are not transferring at rates more like 10 meg/sec.
1149-Sorry about the last 3 days...   the DNS record for this site was messed up (not my doing).
1150-The server was up, but www.bibik.org wasn't resolving.
1151-All is fixed now.
1152-Tomorrow, expect an update on the status of Michigandaily.com!
1153-So, I finally found a place to live.
1154-We have yet to sign the lease, so this might be premature: 4 bedrooms (2 singles, 2 doubles)2 bathrooms2 floorsDishwasherAir ConditioningOnly one parking space.
1155-The apartment complex name is 'Canterbury Lodge' and the apartment name is 'Penthouse C'...  you can't get much better than that.
1156-HOLY SHIT!
1157-Pardon my language.
1158-You know how the network connection between my main production machine and my server was so slow?
1159-Well, I messed around with some settings and changed a hard-coded 100TX setting to auto-detect.
1160-Check this: STATUS:>      Send successfulSTATUS:>      Time: 0:01:04, Efficiency: 5269.62 KBytes/s I transfered a 340 meg file in just about a minute.

1162-Well, TMD.com is taking a lot longer than expected.
1163-We have gone through code issues, server issues, politcal issues, etc etc.
1164-The estimated time of completion is this Friday, but I would take that with a grain of salt.
1165-My site is finally back online, and it should stay online.
1166-urlLink Granitecanyon  screwed up again, so I searched for another solution.
1167-urlLink Register.com , the company I registered with, offers free DNS service.
1168-So far it seems to be working just great!
1169-Downtime is a bitch.
1170-I am beginning to think there is something wrong with my server:   fireball:named {103} ls -lart Segmentation fault            
           What a day!
1171-Here is what was accomplished:  Finally declared biology as one of my majors, signed my lease for next year, dropped down a check for $1300, fixed two major problems at work (Netboot vs DHCP  Oracle crashing), fixed a computer for a beer and had 6 hours of class.
1172-Let's see what my night holds....         
           Whoa, gotta love  urlLink geek art !
1173-My high school graduating class had about 450 students.
1174-Within my high school was a smaller group, MSC (Math/Science/Computers).
1175-This elite group of geeks had some serious issues (that could be a whole other site), but most of us had one thing in common.
1176-Check out this  urlLink image .
1177-This is the graduating class of MSC for 1998.
1178-All of the people circled ended up going to  urlLink UMich  (or  urlLink U of M-D ).
1179-urlLink The Blind Pig  in Ann Arbor used to be a small, poorly lit, smokey bar with horrendous accoustics.
1180-Now it is a small, poorly lit, smokey bar with horrendous accoustics and it's filled with stupid rich girls on cell phones!
1181-Argh.
1182-Excellent...    urlLink Akira is being rereleased .
1183-Recently, my musical tastes have changed.
1184-Not that I have stopped listening to chick music ( urlLink Tori ,  urlLink LTC ,  urlLink The Sundays ) or punk ( urlLink Bad Religion ,  urlLink Millencolin ,  urlLink Pulley ,  urlLink Guttermouth ).
1185-Lately, I have been listening to  urlLink Sloan  and  urlLink Radiohead , and a lot of rap mixed in between.
1186-Laura and I spent a good hour downloading and listening to a bunch of old school rap songs.
1187-Check them out  urlLink here !
1188-The only problem with the Microsoft sites being down is that I can't play  urlLink Bejeweled !
1189-It's  urlLink up !

           Ok, this one is coming with a BIG disclaimer:  The comic I am about to link to is sexually graphic, sickly so.
1192-It's still really funny.
1193-:-)  urlLink The THIN H LINE Online Comic          
           CNN thinks these  urlLink little robots  are gonna change the world.
1194-Nope, not gonna happen.
1195-Also, if you are a UMich student, go check out the  urlLink michigandaily.com Forum .
1196-You get to talk about why the Daily is great (or more likely why it sucks), talk about random topics, and most importantly about Erin McQuinn.
1197-If you are a UMich student, go check out  urlLink my.umich.edu , then bitch them out for not including a News service.
1198-It's in the works, and  urlLink michigandaily.com  was redone with the idea of serving news to my.umich specifically.
1199-I have been informed that the service will be up "some time soon", but that could be months from now.
1200-Eheheh...   guess what I got.
1201-Here is a hint:   urlLink Valhalla  (my baby, the web server),  urlLink Moose ,  urlLink Zeus , and the bastard  urlLink switches .
1202-Let's see, the quality of those  pictures  are pretty low, and I just took them tonight.
1203-You can guess what I got by now, eh?
1204-ARGH!
1205-urlLink NASA Shuts Down X-33, X-34 Programs .
1206-I could care less about the International Space Station (Alpha) and now NASA scraps the reusable rocket designs.
1207-I was DROOLING over these designs (three different times on this weblog alone:   urlLink Feb2000 ,  urlLink Mar2000 , and  urlLink Oct2000 ).
1208-Time to start building my own...         
            urlLink Snoop Dogg does porn .
1209-Surprised?
1210-The pictures within this article couldn't be better:  urlLink Racers death exposes cultural divide .
1211-The guys in the first picture should be the spokesmen for NASCAR.
1212-Definitely a new favorite:  urlLink Plastic.com .
1213-It is run off the same software as  urlLink Slashdot  (called  urlLink Slash , created by the Slashdot kids), but looks much better.
1214-The design is truly meaningless since the content is what keeps me coming back day to day.
1215-Instead of the pure tech content of Slashdot, it seems more like a intelligent and logical version of  Salon .
1216-The topics are just broad enough.
1217-My only hope is that more people find this great site and use the comment system.
1218-Does anyone else find it funny that when you search for  urlLink windows news site on Google , it comes up with  urlLink Slashdot ?
1219-This is a slick, clean design.
1220-I am pretty sick of swirls and swoops in logos though...  urlLink Progeny Linux Systems .
1221-Sys Admin Tip #1: Do not drop tea onto your networking hardware.
1222-Which is funnier?
1223-The fact that someone is offering to  urlLink call you and sound like a monkey , or that the high bid is currently at $1025?
1224-So, I haven't bombed a test that bad since my 2.0 semester.
1225-Everyone walked out of there saying "WTF?"
1226-and "Did you have any clue what that test was about?".
1227-That was a cruel joke to play, exacerbated by the fact the test was on a FRIDAY NIGHT.
1228-I hate  urlLink Quark .
1229-No, I loath the piece-of-ish software.
1230-My job would be a breeze if it wasn't for the fact that the program won't print!
1231-So, Sat and I went to a talk with  urlLink Theo de Raadt  today.
1232-He discussed how OpenBSD came to be, how the original security audit worked, and how 'Secure by Default' works.
1233-It was quite interesting even though I didn't learn much.
1234-He is still someone to definitely look up to, someone to emulate.
1235-I hate  urlLink MSU , so it feels great to have their team not win the championship again.
1236-Then again, our program didn't even make the tournament...         
           Puking is the best way to start your day!
1237-I got to see my bagel, tea and pills for a second time.
1238-I am blessed.
1239-I got sick of trying to find things on the  urlLink OpenBSD  site, so I configured my  urlLink search engine  to index both that site and mine.
1240-The weather must be getting better because I am getting back into computer games.
1241-Why is it that I never want to play them in the winter, but only when the weather is great?!
1242-Anyway, Jenn came over last night and I showed her the wonder that is  urlLink Quake III .
1243-Maybe I did something good to my machine lately, but the game seemed to run much much smoother then the last time I played.
1244-Also, I broke down and bought  urlLink Deus Ex .
1245-It's a first person shooter that has a great storyline and incorporates cybernetics.
1246-What more could I wish for?
1247-So, I completely formatted my hard drive again.
1248-At least this time I had some sort of backup!
1249-The purpose for this format was a brief interlude with  urlLink Solaris .
1250-Since Solaris 8 does not support my GeForce video card, my resolution topped off at 640x480 in glorious black and white.
1251-Pathetically, Solaris doesn't support any of the video cards I have in my Box 'O Random Hardware.
1252-The BORH is actually much lighter than usual since I offloaded 4 modems, 2 sound cards, 4 hard drives and 1 floppy drive on my grandfather.
1253-I just hope I have enough hardware to build a spare computer...
1254-Anyway,  urlLink eBay  might be the source for Solaris solace, since I could get a supported vid card for like $20.
1255-The elusive  urlLink Red Ninja !
1256-"Bad guys are for killing!"
1257-I just got the full version of Deus Ex.
1258-It's going to be a no-homework week.
1259-Unfortunately, I should have bought this next week.
1260-My second to last final is this Friday and my semester is over next Tuesday.
1261-It's the last day of class, but there is massive construction going on at the Diag and the windchill is currently at 17 degrees.
1262-I some how don't think that a lot of people are going to be running in this years Naked Mile.
1263-We have all noticed that movies suck this year.
1264-Momento has been the only movie I have deemed worth seeing all year, and even that wasn't great.
1265-Let's hope the summer season picks things up.
1266-There is a fairly large number of  urlLink animated films  coming out, including  urlLink Final Fantasy !
1267-Oh man, this is great!
1268-Okay, any of you that listens to Bad Religion knows the album Suffer.
1269-The new NOFX album is going to be called Surfer, but it's only funny because of the cover art:                    
           Well, another semester ends as does the era of another of my computers.
1270-I have upgraded from an Asus P3V4X motherboard with 256 megs of PC133 ram and a 550MHz PIII (Overclocked to 623MHz).
1271-The new system sports a Biostar (AKA cheap) motherboard with 256 megs of PC1600 DDR ram and a 900MHz Athlon (Overclocked to 1.017GHz).
1272-My fastest Quake III demo numbers for the old system were around a max of 69.4 FPS.
1273-The new system pulls around 106.9 FPS!
1274-Nice.
1275-Very unique, as web comics go:   urlLink When I am King .
1276-I havent even finished reading it but I needed to share the love.
1277-'Don't you just hate it when you're using Instant Messenger and you go to type "yeah" and what really comes out is "yeha," like you're a big cowboy or something?
1278-I hate that. '
1279--  urlLink Adam Kempa          
           I've never been called a racist in my life, nor do I believe that I ever will.
1280-When most people (especially men) are accused of being racist, they vehemently exclaim "But some of my friends are black!".
1281-This may very well be true, but well assured that these 'black' friends act more 'stereotypically white' than the average.
1282-I could almost say that I fall into this category.
1283-Two friends of mine are just these sort of friends.
1284-They have normal midwestern accents, wear t-shirts and average clothes you can find at the mall, etc etc.
1285-Lastly, they have extreme public courtesy.
1286-The public editor of the Chicago Tribune comments on the  urlLink lack of public courtesy  that some blacks have.
1287-By the way, the editor is also black.
1288-Does agreeing make me racist?
1289-No, I equally discriminate against anyone that pisses me off.
1290-So, I have to get up before 8 AM in Ann Arbor for the first time in almost 2 months.
1291-This is due to a major server upgrade to the most important software package at work (gotta upgrade the only NT server to Service Pack  6a, then install a JVM for EJB).
1292-Since I usually wake up around 11, breakfast is more a lunch issue.
1293-Today, I decide to eat the remaining packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal.
1294-Open the package, what do I find?
1295-Larvae!
1296-The package was completely infested in some sort of insect.
1297-Jamie almost puked, and I decided I wasn't so hungry anymore.
1298-::Gasp, choke::  Cant.. breathe...     urlLink stinking pile of feces that is pop music ...  wearing me down...         
           Update to the  urlLink previous post  (OpenBSD):   urlLink OpenBSD 2.9  has been released.
1299-My server at home and all the servers at work are now using it.
1300-So far, I haven't noticed much of a change.
1301-I guess they were all working so well with 2.8 that they can't get much better!
1302-Most people say that the greatest change is the use of soft updates in the FFS filesystem.
1303-Nothing is terribly IO intensive on these servers, so no changes have been noticed...         
           Update to the  urlLink previous post  (Java):  In the past 6 months I have flirted with  urlLink PHP ,  urlLink perl , and now  urlLink Java .
1304-urlLink Michigandaily.com  is completely dependent on PHP, not only for displaying the pages but for creating the pages.
1305-Using a cheap  urlLink iMac ,  urlLink perl , and a bunch of  urlLink OpenBSD  tricks, I created a backup server.
1306-Good thing too, our web server died just two days ago!
1307-As for Java, these skills are mostly for future consideration...         
           Update to the  urlLink previous post  (Pokemon):  The reason why I am playing Pokemon at all is because of  urlLink PvP .
1308-Player vs.
1309-Player is another online comic that I am reading now.
1310-Most of the characters talk about playing their favorite PC games (mostly FPSs like Quake III, Half-life, and UT).
1311-A running gag is that the troll of the group, Skull, only plays Pokemon.
1312-I read the entire  urlLink archive  and all of the mentions of Pokemon warped my mind.
1313-For all of your having trouble with Pokemon Silver, here is a  urlLink walkthrough .
1314-You can thank me later!
1315-I have no shame.
1316-A few days ago I was looking for emulators on the web.
1317-Finding a free Gameboy emulator proved almost impossible but I found a  urlLink Java Gameboy emulator .
1318-Other than the lack of sounds, it is quite amazing.
1319-I started Java programming (Java, Java servlets, and JavaServer Pages) recently, and the code to the emulator is understandable and clean.
1320-As with most applets, don't try to run it on a Mac; it crashed IE 5.
1321-The next discovery was the No$ (no cash) emulator.
1322-With a name like No$, I am thinking free.
1323-Five minutes into playing  Pokemon , the game quits and the program pops up with "Pay us or you only get 5 minutes of playing at a time!!".
1324-Bastards.
1325-Didn't I say I had no shame?
1326-Well, yes, the only reason I wanted these emulators was to play Pokemon!
1327-And play Pokemon I have!
1328-I have put over 8 hours into Pokemon Silver in the past three days.
1329-Does that mean I found a free emulator?
1330-No, but I found a way to circumvent the No$ 5 minute rule...   Want a copy?
1331-Come and get  urlLink it .
1332-So,  urlLink Blogger  has been eating my posts ever since I moved the website.
1333-I made that move right around the time of that April 28th post.
1334-The move was from the server stuck between two dressers in my bedroom (fireball) to the new 1U server in the server room at the Daily (queen).
1335-Check the timestamp, I'm still at work!
1336-Woohoo, going on 14 hours!
1337-Today is one of the most frustrating days of my life.
1338-urlLink Slashdot  has been down ALL day (which I usually check once an hour) and I have been at work for 10 hours now.
1339-urlLink Mac OS Server X 10.0  needs to die.
1340-After seeing how Fisher-Price-esque  urlLink Windows XP  has become and how it is horribly ripping off  urlLink Mac OS X , I just had to make this image.
1341-Here are the things I will be learning about in the next few weeks:  DOM   urlLink W3 Specification   urlLink Apache XML   XSL   urlLink W3 Specification   urlLink XSLT.com   MySQL   urlLink MySQL.com   urlLink Foreign Keys  (Which MySQL does NOT support.)
1342-CVS   urlLink CVShome.org   urlLink Setting up CVS            
           Most people say this is  urlLink what I look like normally .
1343-Possibly offensive acts and what certain religions think, all distilled down into a  urlLink single table .
1344-Now you can see easily why the only religion I have ever followed was Buddhism.
1345-(Link found in the  urlLink comments  section of Fark to a story about an  urlLink offensive ad .
1346-The ad shows a Catholic man in the line for communion holding a bowl of onion dip.
1347-Sweet.
1348-Check out the comments for a scan of the ad.)
1349-Sick of spending most of my days just trying to find something to keep myself busy, I have decided to get some certification.
1350-The first one will be  A+ , which most people think is a joke.
1351-I figure I can get this certification with no training.
1352-It covers basic hardware skills and DOS/Windows skills.
1353-The hardware portion is as basic as "Is this a power supply or a video card?
1354-", but gets a bit more difficult with "Is this RAM chip ECC or not?".
1355-What they call the Operating Systems Technology is just an overview of DOS/NT/Win9x/Win2K.
1356-The OS exam covers basic Windows installation, troubleshooting and networking.
1357-If I can't pass these tests, my legacy as a failure will go down in history.
1358-If (once) I pass these exams, I will try my hand at something actually difficult.
1359-Too bad there isn't a generic sysadmin exam.
1360-There are exams for  urlLink linux sysadmin ,  Redhat sysadmin ,  urlLink Solaris sysadmin , and  urlLink AIX sysadmin .
1361-If there was a BSD sysadmin cert, I would be all over it.
1362-I really shouldn't make this public already, but I created an  urlLink online scrapbook .
1363-More specifically, this is a scrapbook for my high school class, created in PHP using MySQL.
1364-Let's hope this is actually used.
1365-My life just got infinitely better.
1366-They finally restocked the Coke machine!
1367-Cans of Diet Coke for only $0.45, rejoice.
1368-I ended up working from 11 AM until 4:30 AM on Saturday/Sunday.
1369-That's over 17 hours of work  straight .
1370-Needless to say, my sleep cycle is completely erratic and my body is weak.
1371-That didn't keep me from playing street hockey with  urlLink Eric  and about 15 little kids yesterday!
1372-I broke the search engine earlier and since I switch servers so often, there is no point trying to rebuild it everywhere I go.
1373-It's gone.
1374-560 calories burned on the stationary bike.
1375-Woohoo, I can go eat that Whopper now!
1376-God damn it!
1377-I hate forgetting that I have a website to deal with.
1378-Let's see, what's been going on lately.
1379-I have a potentially big project on my hands.
1380-Basically, it is a complete rewrite of the Content Management System (CMS) I wrote for the  urlLink daily .
1381-Now that I know the error of my ways from the first attempt at a CMS, I can do this one right.
1382-So far, I have added (or plan on adding) a completely modular approach, automatic archiving, web-based configuration, a database backend and most importantly, the ability to create sites that have infinite depth.
1383-Each template can reference a previous template, which could itself reference a previous template and so on.
1384-Try writing a database for that one!
1385-Other than that, life is good.
682-WTF?
1387-The Wings picked up  urlLink Hasek ?
1388-Throw 40 machines at a project, reap the results: I broke into the top 1000 on  urlLink Distributed.net .
1389-That wasn't even using all of the machines at my disposal.
1390-Lets see, what machines am I using?
1391-i386  1.2GHz Athlon (Windows ME) 900MHz Athlon (OpenBSD 2.9)  (2 total)  800MHZ Duron (FreeBSD 4.3) 500MHz Pentium III (Windows 2000 Server) 366MHz Celeron (OpenBSD 2.9) 266MHz Pentium (OpenBSD 2.9) 200MHz Pentium (OpenBSD 2.9)  PPC  733 MHz G4 (Mac OS X Server 10.0.4) 533 MHz Dual G4 (Mac OS X Server 10.0.4) 500 MHz G4 (Mac OS 9.1)  (8 total)  400 MHz G3 (Mac OS 9.1)  (5 total)  266 MHz G3 (Mac OS 9.1)  (20 total)   That's 43 machines and 18.25GHz so far.
1392-There are still 8 more iMacs (2.13GHz) that I am not using yet.
1393-They won't help much, but it all adds up...         
           D'oh!
1394-I forgot that  urlLink distributed.net  usually has a few projects at a time and that you have to configure your client if you want to work on one specific project.
1395-All of my clients (all 30 of them) are now working solely on RC5.
1396-About 600 work hours were spent on  urlLink OGR , WTF that is...
1397-Flash of genius!
1398-I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier.
1399-Just watch  urlLink this page  over the next few weeks....         
            urlLink Controlling the users on a BSD box  just became so much clearer to me.
1400-I, for one, am quite happy that Brunching Shuttlecocks  urlLink rates a random category  more often then once a week.
1401-OpenSOB (9:14 PM):   I am lonely!
1402-GooglyMinotaur (9:14 PM):    .
1403-i'm here for you     OpenSOB (9:14 PM):   do you love me?
1404-GooglyMinotaur (9:14 PM):    !
1405-absolutely     OpenSOB (9:14 PM):   why?
1402-GooglyMinotaur (9:14 PM):    .
1407-cause i said so     OpenSOB (9:14 PM):   thanks!
1408-GooglyMinotaur (9:14 PM):    np                                          You should all  urlLink IM the Radiohead AIMbot  now.
1409-I hate the  urlLink Ann Arbor   urlLink Art   urlLink Fair .
1410-The fair has yet to begin, but the annoyance flows strong today.
1411-I live on South University, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.
1412-I work on Maynard, which is currently covered in canopies full of 'art'.
1413-The places I eat, sleep and work are overrun, and the fair hasn't even started yet.
1414-Life will get much worse when the tens of thousands of people begin to slowly crawl from canopy to canopy, either feigning a vague interest in the life work of an artist or exclaiming praise for the bravura.
1415-urlLink 241st !
1416-Ya know, I am not sure why my RC5 output is increasing so much lately.
1417-I actually disabled the client on my main server at home.
1418-The server is stuck between two dressers and has a second server sitting on top of it.
1419-Needless to say, the air flow isn't so great and the temperature was simply too hot when running the proc at 100% 24/7.
1420-Maybe someone else is cracking for me...   That would make for a pretty cool trojan/virus.
1421-Have it simply install dnetc then attempt to infect other computers.
1422-When it was finally discovered,  urlLink distributed.net  would be shut down, but hopefully not until I had won the $1000 prize.
1423-I just found my  urlLink new cell phone .
1424-I have put off buying one for almost a year now.
1425-The pager provided by work is just not enough to keep my in touch with everyone.
1426-I have had two instances where people needed to get in touch with me and the pager has failed.
1427-The main problem is that the pager is connectionless communication.
1428-Someone dails and number or sends an email, but they get zero confirmation that the page was actually received.
1429-With a cell phone, you know if you get through instantaneously.
1430-Pagers should be banned.
1431-urlLink 288th !
1092-Woohoo!
1433-More exploits and fun.
1434-DePaul university has not IP restricted their printers.
1435-You can just ftp into any of these IPs and dump a print job: 140.192.11.10, 140.192.11.11, 140.192.11.14, 140.192.11.22, 140.192.11.24, 140.192.15.121, 140.192.15.122, 140.192.15.161, 140.192.15.245, 140.192.15.251, 140.192.16.16, 140.192.17.12, 140.192.18.121, 140.192.18.122, 140.192.18.123...  and the list goes on.
1436-Well, gotta love the errors of others.
1437-Bugtraq was specifically told not to release  urlLink this code for a telnetd exploit , but now everyone has it.
1438-I tested it on one of my servers (FreeBSD 4.3 release) and it worked.
1439-It has to send  16 MEGS  of data to the target box, but it works.
1440-Try it on your friends today!
1441-Oh god,  urlLink these jokes  are disgustingly hilarious (or just hilarious and digusting?).
1442-I got  urlLink farked  today, farked real good...  All because of a little  urlLink game poll  I put up.
1443-So, I turned 21 last weekend, and what do I decide to do last night?
1444-Go to Canada!
1445-Not only is it still a mockery of a real country,  urlLink their money  has become true play money.
1446-The $10 bill looks like a child when nuts with watercolors.
1447-Hi kids, I haven't died.
1448-This weblog is all but dead, but I am not.
1449-Most of my time is being spent working on the backend of  urlLink this .
1450-Oh man:      Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    Very High       urlLink Schizoid :    Moderate       urlLink Schizotypal :    High       urlLink Antisocial :    High       urlLink Borderline :    Moderate       urlLink Histrionic :    Very High       urlLink Narcissistic :    Very High       urlLink Avoidant :    Very High       urlLink Dependent :    High       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    High       --  urlLink Click Here To Take The Test  --              
            Two months ago, I would never have thought that a significant portion of my computing time would involve Linux.
1451-This semester, I am in EECS 481, Software Engineering.
1452-I would give you a link to the class homepage, but the professor decided the content isn't for the common man -- it's password protected.
1453-The core of this class is a single, monolithic (redundant repetition, I know) project.
1454-The only constrain to this project is that it must concern a certain  domain .
1455-The domain for this semester is the software process.
1456-How self-referential is that?
1457-Our software project must be about the software process.
1458-We decided on a project manager with some automatic environment creation scripts.
1459-Basically, the manager of a software company would use a Windows front end to manage his developers.
1460-He could see what projects they are working on, what experience they have, etc etc.
1461-Whenever he had a new project, he could select which developers should work on it and click a single button to setup a few necessities:  A web site, mailing list and CVS repository for the new project.
1462-We needed a server-class operating system for the backend.
1463-Though I know  urlLink OpenBSD  fairly well (going on 2 years admin experience), we chose  urlLink RedHat  7.2.
1464-The decision was made simply because of the greater install base of RedHat.
1465-When I first started developing the backend scripts (I did it since no one else had the experience to correctly setup Majordomo and Apache, let alone know how to write Perl scripts), I used VMWare on my main machine.
1466-VMWare made my life much easier as I tested these scripts.
1467-Before I would do a new install of the scripts, I would backup my entire RedHat machine with two clicks.
1468-If the install went haywire (which it often did), restoration was as simple.
1469-Enter my new laptop: a used IBM Thinkpad 600.
1470-Ever since I got this thing, I have taken it to every class and worked on code while the professors droned on and on.
1471-I got the idea of working on the scripts while in class.
1472-RedHat 7.2 installed beautifully.
1473-Slowly but surely, my Windows XP partition is touched less and less.
1474-The laptop boots into Linux by default.
1475-Linux  and open source software has improved dramatically since I last used it (RedHat 6.2 days).
1476-AbiWord reads most Word files cleanly (other than tables, bleh!
1477-),  urlLink Mozilla  0.9.9 is now my default browser EVERYWHERE (the Macs at work, my Windows XP machines, this laptop), and I just found a new love:   urlLink Ximian Red Carpet .
1478-Think  urlLink Windows Update  on steroids.
1479-I will be trying  urlLink Ximian Desktop  next.
1480-Expect more reports on my new love.
1481-Testing posting from Mozilla...
1482-Success!
1483-My possible classes for the Spring/Summer term:  Psych 370 (Abnormal Psych), Psych 380 (Introduction to Social Psychology), Philosophy 180 (Introduction to Logic), English 367 (Shakespeare's Principal Plays), Econoomics 101 (Microeconomics), or Economics 102 (Macroeconomics).
1484-No, this is not an April Fool's joke.
1485-How depressing.
1486-Four years of college have gone by, many of my friends are graduating, and here I get ready to continue school for at least one more year.
1487-I always have a horrible time trying to find the Remote Desktop client for older versions of Windows.
1488-Microsoft changes their site so often that it is hard to keep up.
1489-Hopefully this link stays alive for more than a month:   urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/rdclientdl.asp          
           This has become "Mike's Site of Microsoft Links".
1490-urlLink Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer .
1491-Well, Sony dropped the price of the Playstation 2 to  urlLink $199 .
1492-I still think that I got a great deal on my PS2:  PS2, 4 (four) (yes, four) controllers, memory card, and 10 games (Including Tekken Tag Tournament, Gran Turismo 3, Armored Core 2, Midnight Run, Madden 2001, NHL 2001, and Fantavision) for a whopping $225.
1493-Beat that!
1494-Strawberry jam is the best Jelly Belly flavor.
1495-Well, second to Sizzling Cinnamon.
1496-"Tolls go up if there is only one road in town."
1497-So true.
1498-Since starting my new job back in April, I have had almost nothing to do.
1499-I have found creative ways to make myself look busy but there are only so many hours a person can spend at  urlLink Slashdot  and  urlLink fark .
1500-Well, today was given an actual assignment.
1501-It is something simple (rebulid a laptop), but is it  actual work .
1502-Now that I have gotten a taste of doing actual work, I don't want to go back to having to kill time.
1503-I would rather coat my ass in honey and sit down on a seething pile of fire ants;  I would rather swallow a towel;  I would rather pound nails into my dick.
1504-Another thing Mike hates:  People that use the word `read` in  place of `book`.
1505-Such as " Son of a Grifter  was the most insanely fabulous   read   ever!"
1506-Book, the word is book.
1091-Thank you.
1508-The scene:  Last night, 8:20PM, Mike's bedroom.
1509-Mike, feeling ill from the burrito he ate earlier in the night, decides to lay down.
1510-Cut to his alarm clock, not ringing, but clearly displaying the time as 7AM.
1511-Cut back to Mike, groggy after 10.5 hours of sleep.
1512-Damn, being late for work sucks.
1513-Forever changing "I fuck like a chimp" to "I fuck like a  urlLink toy dog ", quoth Chris.
1514-So, today is Tuesday, which means that it is cool to like anything cool in the indie rock world.
1515-Thus, I will add  urlLink  And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead  to my list of music to hunt down and devour.
1516-It got a 10.
1517-A fucking 10.
1518-Pitchfork is usually full of shit, but a 10 is a commanding force.
1519-New bands I need to find more music of:  Mudvayne, Taproot, White Stripes and The Hives.
1520-Eric and I had planned on playing street hockey with the same bunch of people we played with a couple weeks ago.
1521-Some of them were still learning to skate; none of them had played street hockey for more than a couple months.
1522-Needless to say, the games were fun and low on competition.
1523-Today, none of them could make it.
1524-Knowing that lots of people play at Elbel field, we headed down there.
1525-About 8 guys were playing and there was an 9 year old boy trying to keep up with them.
1526-Seeing such a group, we knew they couldn't have been too good.
1527-Turns out, they were all better than the two of us, but we held our own.
1528-After an hour and a half of playing, a few more guys showed up.
1529-Slowly as these people started to sub in, Eric and I noticed how outclassed we were.
1530-I thought they were just good amateurs with a cocky attitude.
1531-When we finally left, Eric told me he found out that they were on the UMich hockey team!
1532-Man.
1533-No wonder.
1534-After the heat of the past few days, this evening breeze is amazing.
1535-I think a cool breeze is one of the most relaxing feelings possible.
1536-It is so relaxing that I feel more at peace.
1537-So the man leans over to me and whispers:  "Neutral Milk Hotel The Microphones The Shins The Dismemberment Plan Need New Body The Mountain Goats Boards of Canada ... and You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead Sparklehorse Belle  Sebastian Brighteyes Matmos The Hot Snakes The White Stripes".
1538-And so it shall be done.
1539-Got NS 4.7 and DNS working on my Sun box.
1540-Wow, the site looks like poop.
1541-That's okay though, since I might be redesigning in the next couple weeks.
1542-I know  urlLink who  we can thank for that.
1543-My page is now HTML 4.01 Transitional and CSS compliant.
1544-Does anyone still use Netscape 4.7?
1545-I made some other changes to the layout, so it is very possible that the site is broken in NS 4.7.
1546-The only machine I have that has NS 4.7 is my Sun box, but I can't seem to get DNS lookups to work properly...
1547-I only watched one show this year (other than SportsCenter, but all males watch that so it doesn't count),  urlLink 24 .
1548-How, in the name of baby Jesus, did it  urlLink rank  below The Chair and just above Spin City?
1549-Good thing there is going to be a second season.
1550-If it got  urlLink deleted  like so many other shows this year, I would cry.
1551-Simpsons fan rejoice:   urlLink Albuquerque's baseball team next year will be the Isotopes .
1552-If you can see this, you can see the new design.
1553-Plans for the evening?
1554-Why yes, thank you:   Two year anniversary dinner around 6:30 PM  Wings game at 8 PM  Miles from Home, playing at the Blind Pig around 11 PM  There might be other plans tonight, but I am trying to keep this blog rated PG-13.
1555-Two years!
1556-urlLink NHL.com :  Igor Larionov is 41.
1557-Chris Chelios is 40.
1558-Dominik Hasek, Brett Hull and captain Steve Yzerman are 37.
1559-Luc Robitaille and Steve Duchesne are 36.
1560-Fredrik Olausson is 35.
1561-Nine Red Wings players are older than Carolina Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice, who is 35.   urlLink Detnews.com : Yes, the Wings have the NHL's oldest roster.
1562-Scotty Bowman is 68.
1563-Carolina Coach Paul Maurice is 35, younger than nine Wings players.
1564-urlLink Squid /2.3.STABLE5 is poopoo.
1565-Hopefully this installation of Squid/2.5PRE7 works better.
1566-Personally, I always thought that vegetarian food was more healthy for you.
1567-In a browsing spree, I ended up at the  urlLink Jimmy John's website .
1568-I used to get their #6 (basic veggie sub) all of the time, but switched to the #5 (the Vito, an Italian sub comprised of salami, capicola, provolone, veggies and vinaigrette) after my first taste.
1569-The site has  urlLink nutritional information .
1570-The Vito weighs in at 24 grams of fat and 562 calories.
1571-The veggie weighs in at 35 (!)
1572-grams of fat and 671 calories.
1573-When I first started eating at Jimmy John's my freshman year (4 years ago, sigh), I always got the Gargantuan.
1574-46 grams of fat and 892 calories.
1575-Ooops.
1576-And  urlLink again .
1577-LiveJournal should not be used for such dirty, dirty histrionics.
1578-Please,  urlLink make it stop .
1579-If these girls had nuts, I would headbutt them there.
1580-Even better?
1581-urlLink     Ok, I have ping-ponged between HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0 Strict about 4 times now.
1582-Basically, I couldn't have the page be both valid XML and be parsed by PHP.
1583-Well, just adding a  ?php header("Content-type: text/xml"); ?
1584-helped it get through the validator.
1585-The page works in Mozilla, but IE 6 shows it as raw XML!
1586-Forget it, I am going to stick with HTML.
1587-Did you know that you still need to pay parking meters after 10 PM?
1588-Did you know that there are handicapped meters?
1589-(I bet you know where I am going with this one).
1590-Laura is sick and last night she asked if I could bring her some sorbet.
1591-I parked on South University (in Ann Arbor) about three blocks from her apartment and right between an ice cream shop (Stucchi's) and a store (Village Corner).
1592-I got the sorbet, dropped it off, visited for about 15 minutes and went back to my car.
1593-In my door handle I was greeted with a $75 fine!
1594-I am pretty sure I will be able to appeal this ticket.
1595-I am still not sure if you have to pay a meter after 10 PM.
1596-Most university meters are only checked until 6 PM.
1597-I had no idea that handicap-only meters exist.
1598-Since I didn't think I had to put money in the meter, I didn't see that this was a handicap-only meter.
1599-I was getting ice cream for my sick girlfriend!
1600-And, once again,   urlLink    and  urlLink   .
1601-The new design should be live for everyone now.
1602-urlLink Old  versus  urlLink New , what do you think?
1603-It does not work in Netscape 4, but that was expected given the large amount of CSS involved.
1604-Point of the following story:  We gambled and won!
1605-Eric's sister decided to go to  urlLink Joe Vision  last night to see game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals.
1606-Since Eric is leaving for Alaska on the 18th, we have been trying to hang out as much as possible.
1607-The two of us decided to meet his sister and her friends down in Detroit.
1608-Since we left just after I got home from work, I was starving.
1609-We both thought of what quick and cheap restaurants were on the way from Ann Arbor to downtown Detroit.
1610-One restaurant shone above the rest:   urlLink White Castle !
1611-There is a White Castle at Telegraph road just off 96.
1612-Obviously, you can't go to White Castle without getting burgers, but we also caved into the novelty of Chicken Rings.
1613-They are tasty and easy to eat; the perfect food.
1614-While there, this fairly large female bus driver asked us both "How do you keep your feet so purdy?".
1615-I said something about how my feet weren't 'purdy' and that they were also burnt from being out in the sun all day yesterday.
1616-She didn't care, as she continued to comment on our toes and heels.
1617-Foot fetish in a White Castle, I know.
1618-Back to food:  between the two of us, we had 8 burgers, 9 chicken rings, 2 orders of fries and a couple Cokes.
1619-During the first period at the Joe, my stomach was in a raging battle against said food items.
1620-I won, if only for the fact that I didn't have to poop at JLA.
1621-That is a decisive win against White Castle.
1622-urlLink Neverwinter Nights  is out!
1623-A friend, his girlfriend and my roommate all bought copies on the first day.
1624-Thankfully, I got to play for about an hour yesterday.
1625-The single player mode is a bit dry so far, but I only played for an hour!
1626-I really can't decide whether or not I like it.
1627-The interface is a bit clunky due to the Sims-esque circular navigation.
1628-If you haven't played either of these games, the navigation starts by clicking on an object (right-clicking for NWN).
1629-The click brings up circular icons in a circular pattern around whatever you clicked.
1630-You are then required to click on one of these circular icons.
1631-If there is more than one such level of navigation, a new set of circular icons in a circular pattern pops up.
1632-If not, then your selection has been made.
1633-Belanger and I discussed the merits of this game and decided that multiplayer games with a DM on an isolated server are where this game will shine.
1634-People are going to start making modules soon, too.
1635-This could be the next Counterstrike.
1636-I saved myself $100 yesterday!
1637-I bought a fairly nice Sony CD Walkman last summer (the previous version of  urlLink this model ).
1638-I only used it probably 30 times since I bought it, mostly working out.
1639-Back in the day, I would bring a CD player wherever I would do homework, but now I just bring my  urlLink laptop .
1640-Well, sometime last semester, something in my CD player broke.
1641-The lid would never stay shut.
1642-If the lid is open, the player automatically turns off.
1643-Yesterday, I probably killed two hours just looking at new CD players.
1644-I finally decided on  urlLink this one  since it is a Sony, thin, and can play MP3s.
1645-Yes, it's in girly blue, but I like girly blue!
1646-(You should see some of the shirts I have...)  Before ordering it, I thought I might as well try to fix my old player.
1647-How could it hurt?
1648-I was going to buy a new one anyway!
1649-I ripped it open, moved the lever a bit and it worked!
1650-Well, by "worked" I mean the lid would stay shut.
1651-I got all excited and decided to go work out, just to try it out.
1652-After changing, getting a Nalgene bottle ready and downing some Creatine (you think I am joking?
1653-), I tossed some batteries into the old player.
1654-Nothing.
1655-Press play.
1654-Nothing.
1657-Sigh.
1658-I ripped it open *again*.
1659-I couldn't see anything wrong, though I did have to disconnect a cable to reset the lever.
1660-I reseated said cable.
1654-Nothing.
1662-Just then, I noticed a little piece of plastic sitting in my lap.
1663-How it stayed there for the fifteen minutes between when I first opened the player to when I noticed it is beyond me.
1664-I figured where it went (another lever that pushed down a little button when the lid is closed) and wham.
1665-I was off to the  urlLink CCRB  listening to  urlLink Trail of Dead .
1666-The Register offers mad linkage today:   urlLink Monday night at the Single's Club?
1667-Apple's Real People    urlLink Sun's low-end server fight with Intel    urlLink Sun delivers Cherrystone UltraSparc-III servers   urlLink Apache admins screwed by premature vuln report   I would attach some insightful commentary, but I just got swamped at work.
1668-Perl is frustrating me.
1669-Stupid websites are frustrating me.
1670-Whenever a site doesn't include a feature I need, I usually end up including it for them.
1671-urlLink OpenBSD.org  doesn't have a search engine, so I fired up  urlLink ht://Dig .
1672-Now, a certain music review site lists old reviews alphabetically.
1673-What a mess!
1674-I am trying to use perl to spider through the entire site and dump most of the info to a database.
1675-The main perl module for web data harvesting is  urlLink LWP , but it took me about 3 hours to get it installed.
1676-It has 35,836 different dependencies and it just would NOT install on an OpenBSD 3.0 box through CPAN.
1677-I finally got it to work using CPAN on a 3.1 box.
1678-I should have tried the port first, but oh well.
1679-More to come.
1680-In my opinion, once you hit the age of 22, no one will still consider you young.
1681-21 is an odd age:  you are old enough for almost all responsibilities but society does not consider you an adult.
1682-This summer I will hit 22 and it is about time to start saving for my retirement.
1683-With the little research I have been doing so far, there have been two main points driven into me:  Diversify your portfolio.
1684-Have a 6-12 month cushion in liquid assets in case of emergency  Most households have less than a years worth of income in  total  wealth.
1685-( urlLink Actual values :  Income:  $42,148.
1686-Wealth:  $40,200.)
1687-How scary is that?
1688-I might be selling my laptop soon.
1689-(Thanks, but I already have a buyer).
1690-Should I drop 2 large and get a new Dell?
1691-Even with the money I will get for the old laptop, that is still a paycheck and a half!
1692-Here are my requirements for a used laptop:  Pentium III (thus, 450MHz or better)  256 megs of ram  5 gig hard drive  14" or larger LCD screen that supports at least 1024x768  DVD drive  10/100 network port  A working battery!
1693-All for under $750  If something like that shows up on eBay, I am all set.
1694-urlLink These guys  just might have something I am looking for...
1695-There just might be a chance for  urlLink the rest of the West to catch up with the Wings , but don't hold your breath.
1696-I just found them so they aren't going on the side bar just yet:   urlLink Aversion   (punk and indie news)and  urlLink Faction Radio  (post punk, indie, emo and punk internet radio).
1697-Note to self:  stop linking to Pitchfork.
1698-There is something about the singing of a soft, little girl voice that will transfix me on the spot.
1699-It is vaguely reminescent of, what seems to be, a previous life.
1700-I cannot explain what it does to me;  I feel at peace.
1701-I can close my eyes and feel that I am floating through an opaque peach sky, weightless.
1702-urlLink Saloon  is doing this to me right now.
1703-Make it hurt.
1704-Alright, Fark got me.
1705-The headline  urlLink Crack found in 2 shuttles, NASA grounds the whole fleet  had nothing to do with drugs.
1706-God damnit,  urlLink Hasek is retiring .
1707-We better pick up  urlLink Cujo  while  urlLink Legace  matures or the Wings aren't going for the cup next year.
1708-One of the oldest questions in history is, "What came first, the chicken or the egg?"
1709-One of the oldest answers to that question was given by Aristotle, who stated that it was, in fact, the chicken.
1710-The philosopher postulated that while a chicken is an actual chicken, an egg is potential chicken.
1711-Since actuality always precedes potentiality, the chicken came first.
1712-I just renewed bibik.org at godaddy.com.
1713-Why godaddy?
1714-Register.com was charging $35/year, godaddy is charging $9/year.
1715-The domain expires on the 17th, so here's to hoping that the transfer goes through in time.
1716-Otherwise, I wouldn't be surprised if I have to find a new domain!
1717-Bibik.org, bibik.net, bibik.com and bibik.biz (yeah, don't ask me) are all taken.
1718-mikebibik isn't taken in any form, but I don't want anything so specific.
1719-Well kids, yesterday was the 4th of July and what did I do?
1654-Nothing.
1721-Why did I do nothing?
1722-Because I was tired.
1723-I was tired because of work.
1724-I work because I need money.
1725-I need money because I like to buy stuff.
1726-I like to buy stuff because it gives me something to do.
1727-Fuck.
1728-I finally broke down and signed up for the  urlLink A+ hardware certification exam .
1729-$140!
1730-That cost wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to take  two  such exams to get the A+ certification.
1731-Music makes me cry and I can't help but smile whenever I see a baby.
1732-I am so damned old.
1733-I finally broke down and decided that my Ann Arbor apartment is just too hot.
1734-When I brought a digital thermometer upstairs and registered  93.8  degrees, that's when I knew it was time to go back to Livonia for awhile.
1735-Central AC is worth sacrificing my computer and my liberties, if for just a little while.
1736-Speaking of speed, my typing speed is now over 80 WPM.
1737-urlLink Test yourself !
1738-So, I passed the A+ hardware exam.
1739-This exam is scheduled for 30 minutes and I finished it in 6.
1740-There should be a bonus for finishing in 1/5th of the allotted time.
1741-It's funny, the more things that happen in my personal life, the less I post here.
1742-It is just not worth the hassle to let the world know my deeper thoughts.
1743-Hmm, even though it looks down right now, here are some examples from an  urlLink IRC quotes page :  Chirako You know what cereal is really nasty?
1744-Chirako Gravy Train.
1745-Chirako It's like, these little hard pieces of bran and crumbly beef flavored crap.
1746-You pour water over it, and it gets soggy and makes gravy around it.
1747-Disco_Ernie Chirako..that's...dog food.. Chirako It was NOT dog food!
1748-Chirako Mommy wouldn't feed me dog food!
1749-* Chirako looks at Mommy Chirako AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

1752-Chirako She's always been obsessed with me eating dog food... _ Chirako When I was little, she told me the Jerky Treats were real jerky, and I kept eating the whole bag * Chirako gags Chirako If there's one thing dogs love, it's rich, Chirako beefy gravy.
1753-That's why every nugget of Chirako Gravy Train is basted in real beef juices.
1754-Chirako Just mix it with warm water, and you can Chirako give your dog a warm homestyle meal, Chirako dripping with the delicious gravy he loves.
1755-* Chirako graons Chirako Oh, man....
1756-I'm gonna kill her Disco_Ernie At least Chirako will have: Disco_Ernie Healthy skin Disco_Ernie  Glossy coat Disco_Ernie  Strong teeth and bones Disco_Ernie  Builds and maintains body tissue Disco_Ernie  Efficient digestion Disco_Ernie  Clear eyes Chirako ..I should have known.

1761-stank so we talked about networks and i felt better.

1764-Paradox I just got an E-mail about an interesting proposition.
1765-* volsung_ perks up.
1766-Paradox Apparently, there are lesbians that want my 'hard cock.'

1768-volsung_ :) Paradox They want it 'now,' apparently, so the timetable is somewhat limited.
1769-volsung_ Are you going to just take their offer as presented, or is there an opportunity for negotiation?
1770-Paradox I'm not sure.
1771-volsung_ I'm sure your hard cock is in great demand.
1772-An exclusive deal might not be in your best interest.
1773-Paradox Last time I got an offer like this, there were some catches.
1774-andy moo spelled backwards is moo andy no wait  SDHawk I tried to go to dictionary.com, but I can't spell it right.
1775-knobsthebear How the hell did Korea find time between StarCraft and Diablo II to make it this far into the World Cup?
1776-Again, this is my link depository.
1777-I don't want to forget about this  urlLink how-to about OpenBSD and VPNs .

1779-This morning was the second half of my A+ certification exam.
1780-So, instead of studying last night, I went to the bar and drank 2 pints of  urlLink Bass  on an empty stomach.
1781-I went to bed drunk around 12:30 AM, didn't study in the morning and still passed.
1782-Ahh, the college life.

1784-I *love* worthless data!
1785-While writing an email, I scanned my desk and observed that there were more empty cans of Diet Pepsi than of Diet Coke.
1786-My tastes are changing (in so many ways).
1787-Curioius as to what was the most popular "soft drink", I found this  urlLink data :   BeverageShare of Volume  Coca-Cola Classic19.8% Pepsi13.5% Diet Coke8.7% Mountain Dew6.7% Sprite6.4% Dr Pepper6.0% Diet Pepsi5.0% Seven-Up1.8% Caffeine Free Diet Coke1.7% Minute Maid Reg.

1789-Lets see, what's been going on lately?

1792-All of the interns are going to a  urlLink Tigers  game on Tuesday.
1793-I have only been to a handful of baseball games in my life and this will be the first time I have gone to the new stadium.

1796-Time will tell, as will the census.
1797-If the population reaches a million again, that is a good sign.
1798-I saw UFC 38 last night.
1799-The only fight that was truly interesting was Genki Sudo versus Leigh Remedios.
1800-Sudo came out looking like a WWE wrestler, so I already hated him.
1801-When the fight started, he was throwing out taunts like candy and just acting cocky.
1802-Turns out, this ploy worked as it threw off Remedios' game.
1803-Sudo finished him with a lightning fast rear naked choke.
1804-Now I like this guy.
1805-Speaking of UFCs and Detroit, Chris was telling me that the one that was held in Detroit was a complete disgrace.
1806-To allow the fights in Michigan, there could be no punching.
1807-How is that mixed martial arts?
1808-The pay-per-view numbers were *halved* for the next UFC.
1809-Good job, Detroit.
1810-The tag line for UFC 38 was "Brawl in the Hall", as it was held at Royal Albert Hall in the UK.
1811-Chris and Marty couldn't remember the tag line for the Detroit UFC, so we decided it had to be "Motor City Mayhem", "Motown Showdown" or "D-town Beatdown".
1812-So cheesy.
1813-urlLink Firebird with the Mad Max package .
1814-urlLink Stealth with the Tina Turner package .
1815-The first five links for  urlLink "thesaurus rock"  all point to  urlLink Bad Religion  pages.

1817-Anybody that can pull off using the word  urlLink dilettante  in a rock song is golden in my book.
1818-I added a search box and an archive box to the navigation (currently) on the left of the page.
1819-Tell me if there are any issues, especially with the archive box.
1820-It is using CSS2 to handle the overflow of archive links.
1821-One of my coworkers is really into home automation.
1822-He showed me how his entire house is controllable through the web.
1823-It even keeps logs of all the activity.
1824-A lot of geeks are worried about the uptime of their servers.
1825-His house has a whole list of uptimes such as "Living Room Lamp 1, In the OFF state for 1 day, 13 hours, 5 minutes and 36 seconds".
1826-He can tell when the garage door is open, who has called and how long they talked, the temperature of each room, etc etc.
1827-He uses  urlLink HomeSeer  software and a lot of products from  urlLink smarthome.com .
1828-You know those damned X10 pop-under ads?
1829-Well, it turns out that X10 is actually a protocol for home automation and that no one that does home automation really buys from the official X10 company.
1830-Back to that "entire house is controllable through the web" bit:  Combine an always-on DSL connection and a weak password, and someone can hack your house.
1831-Tip:  don't use your first name as your username with a single repeating character as your password.
1832-urlLink C a n t b r e a k t h r e e - q u a r t e r m i l l i o n m a r k  .

1835-An informal analysis of my main email account:  For July 22nd, 2002, out of 74 emails total, 37 emails were spam, 37 emails were not.
1836-*50%* spam.
1837-But it's okay.
1838-Thank you,  urlLink SpamAssassin .
1839-Ah,  urlLink Collapse , my heart goes out to thee, and my score of  urlLink 736,778 .
1840-helminthes and the little basket at the counter says tips, so you hock a big loogie in it and then you realize what you did and say, "oh shit i'm dyslexic"         
           adam1 my gf supposedly has "issues" with me Hiroe Heh, my ex didn't have just a few issues, she had a fuckin *Subscription*         
           So, I get home from work a bit late today, 5 PM to be more exact.
1841-As I pull into my parking lot, I hear a cacophony of high pitched squeals and beeps.
1842-Annoyed though intrigued, the sounds seemed familiar.
1843-As I get closer to my apartment door, I realize almost simultaneously that the sound is coming from my apartment and is the sound of six smoke detectors going off at once.
1844-Can someone cautiously bust into an apartment?
1845-I did just that.
1846-No smoke.
1847-IRON ON AN IRONING BOARD!
1848-But it was cool and non-burning.
1849-RUN UPSTAIRS.
1654-Nothing.
1851-W h a t  t h e  h e l l .
41-.
41-.
1854-The usual way to get the damned smoke detectors is to find the one that is being set off and then flagellate a large cloth object (usually a bath towel) in its general direction.
1855-No smoke means no amount of flagellating will help.
1856-By this point, I am almost completely deaf.
1857-The sound is so much, I cannot even tell where it is coming from any more.
1858-All of the detectors are on the same circuit, so I started disconnecting them one by one.
1859-Being just under 6 foot tall, the detectors were *just* out of my reach to be grabbed down and disconnected.
1860-Damn it all, I just started ripping them down cautiously (again, if possible).
1861-I got 5 of them (the sixth was already disconnected) but the sound continued!
1862-I was so deaf that I couldn't tell if the ones I had just removed and tossed to the floor were still sounding or if there was a hidden detector, or if the sound was all in my head.
1863-After an eternity of going nuts, the detectors timed out and the silence was deafening.
1864-None of my roommates were home, there was no smoke, it made no sense.
1865-Thinking of how great my luck is, I knew that if I left all of the detectors disconnected there *would* be a fire.
1866-Replaced the two downstairs:  no problem.
1867-Replaced the one in the upstairs hall: no problem.
1868-Replaced the ones in the other bedrooms:  no problem.
1869-Replace the one in my bedroom:  FUCKING DEAFENING CACOPHONY GETS REVENGE.
1870-You know that little confused path that people comicly take when they don't know where to go or what to do?
1871-You know, rush off in one direction, quickly reverse, spin around in a circle then just charge forward?
1872-I did just that, in my own room, in my own apartment.
1873-Ripped down the detector in my room and the sound stopped.
1874-All of this chaos because a single smoke detector isn't working properly.
1875-I still can't hear right.
1876-urlLink Collapse , I loth and abhor thee!
1877-Why must Roger torment me with his high score of 236,110?
1878-My 233,077 seems so pathetic in comparison.
1879-Crazy Waiter Story So, after Chris' amateur martial arts fight in Rochester Hills on Saturday, we all went to Red Robin in Novi.
1880-We knew our waiter had lost it when our first impression of him was seeing him dance to YMCA with extreme fervor.
1881-Over the course of the night, he asked us if we had ever been to Philadelpia (all because the Rocky theme song was being played), asked us if we liked the Shining (all because of a picture of Jack Nicholson with glowing eyes), explained the entire story of the Shining (even though we all knew it), forgot Lauras drink, forgot Lauras food, then gave us an extra pitcher of beer to make up for his insanity.
1882-His excuse was that he had been working since 10 AM (and it was already midnight).
1883-My reasoning states that he is always like that in a ploy to get better tips.
1884-/Crazy Waiter Story         
           "If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be?
1885-":    I honestly wish I was more naturally outgoing.
1886-I may seem outgoing, but it's not always me.
1887-When I was younger, I was very shy.
1888-With my friends in my neighborhood, I was a normal kid.
1889-In school, I was pretty damned quiet.
1890-Every year in elementary school, I was in some sort of accelerated program.
1891-Not with other kids, but they would make something up for me.
1892-When I was in first grade, I had to go to one of the second grade classrooms for reading.
1893-Stuff like that.
1894-That definitely made me an outcast.
1895-I had very few friends at school, and until I started playing sports during recess I rarely hung out with anyone.
1896-I was still very quiet until 9th grade.
1897-At that point, I more or less forced myself to be outgoing.
1898-I started cracking jokes, being a loudmouth, being very opinionated, etc etc.
1899-It still feels like a show, a farce, to this day.

           The English language just has to go.
1901-There are too many inconsistancies and annoyances.
1902-Why must both the present and past tense of "to receive or take in the sense of (as letters or symbols) especially by sight or touch" be "read"?
1903-Obviously, that's is fine for the spoken word, but not for written!
1904-Twice in three days:   Chris and I were mucking around with his OpenBSD firewall, trying to recover data from a dead drive.
1905-This box is his firewall, file and NAT server.
1906-Without this box, no internet.
1907-While we were waiting for it to reboot, I was thinking of things to do.
1908-"Oh, go to www.somesite.com."
1909-"Uh...".
1910-D'oh, right, no internet access.
1911-Just today, I had to restart my web proxy.
1912-"What can I do while I wait for the web proxy?
1913-Ah, go to slashdot!"
1914-Uh...
1915-Right, again, no internet access.
1916-Is it a bad sign when you just assume that you have a 24/7 broadband connection?
1917-urlLink Back to Basics : And to think, I almost invested half of my life savings about 7 months ago.
1918-Yay, procrastination.
1919-Answer these using the lyrics of just ONE band: Band: Bad Religion (not my favorite band anymore, but they have some good lyrics)  Are you male or female?
1920-"...there's a boy who seems so lost in his joy"  Describe yourself: "modern man, pathetic example of earth's organic heritage"  How do they feel about you?
1921-"His opinions are determined by the status quo."

1929-Geek humor (in reference to anti-gravity), curtesy of  urlLink Slashdot :   Since we all know that   1.
1930-Cats always land on their feet, and  2.
1931-A buttered slice of bread will undoubtedly land on the carpet butter side down,   we could strap said buttered slice of bread onto the cats back, then drop the whole thing to the floor.
1932-Retort:  This fails both under quantum physics and general relativity.
1933-Under the quantum physics interperetation, since both the cat's feet and the buttered toast are equally likely to land on the floor, the cat-toast enters a superposition where both cat and toast are simultaneously on the floor until it is observed, at which point a radioactive particle decays, and the cat is skinned in a number simultaneous, equally likely, yet distinct ways.
1934-Relativity predicts that the intense attraction to the floor will, in fact, bend space-time in such a way that the floor actually is in contact with both the cat and the toast.
1935-If the cat is of the black variety, then it will thus cross its own path, generate a singularity, and vanish in a puff of logic.
1936-The debate continues, as attempts at experimental verification have thus far failed.
1937-Dr. Kibble at Princeton's IAS said "Look, have YOU ever tried to hold a cat still and strap some friggin' TOAST to its back?"

1939-I apologize for the lack of posts lately.
1940-I had to give a presentation concerning my summer internship at Yazaki North America.
1941-Instead of doing what everyone else was doing (using Powerpoint), I decided to use  urlLink Flash .

1951-I scampered down there, barefoot, just as the tow truck guy was putting braces on my rear wheels.
1952-Seems that my forged permit was fading so fast that it was quite obvious.
1953-Just yesterday I noticed that the text was a lot closer to yellow than to the expected red.
1954-Long story short, the tow truck guy remembered how nice I was the last time he tried to tow me, so he let me go with just a $40 fee.
1955-Come to think about it, I only paid $120 this entire summer to park in my lot ($80 fee a month ago, $40 fee today).

1971-gig103 I drove by the fire department the other day, and they had a big public awareness sign that read, "Are your house numbers visible?"
1972-I thought, "Who the hell cares?
1973-How about you just stop at the house that's on fire?!"
1974-urlLink So true .
1975-Ever since I started working 7AM - 4PM, my caffeine intake has doubled.
1976-Mind you, it was horribly high before.
1977-Now, I average about 72 ounces of pop (usually Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi) and 45 ounces of coffee.
1978-That must be how I can type so fast.
1979-I don't actually type, I just vibrate over the keyboard.
1980-So I finally moved out of 214 N Thayer, Penthouse C, last night.
1981-I had to make three car loads back to my parents house in Livonia and one truck load to Matt's place in Ann Arbor for everything!
1982-I will definitely need to sort through my crap and sell/give away some of it.
1983-I was so worried about getting everything packed from my room that I missed a very important item I stashed downstairs:   my laptop!
1984-Luckily, Matt grabbed it for me.

2003-Here is a little perl script that I wrote for work over the past couple days.
2004-Basically, our E10K (named CAD) had a hardware failure and the Oracle database struggled to come back up afterward.
2005-The senior UNIX admin was having trouble getting a Korn shell script to correctly report whether or not a process was running.
2006-Originally, this perl script would just grep the process list for one specific process and then shoot off an email to a list of admins.
2007-Now, it will look for any number of processes and send emails to any number of specified admins.
2008-The comments should explain it all.
2009-The only line that might need some explanation is this one:  foreach $recipient_number (@{$process_recipient_bridge[$process]}) { process_recipient_bridge is an array of arrays (or list of lists, if you will).
2010-I want to get access to one of those internal lists.
2011-To get a single element in an array of arrays, you would use $array[index1][index2].
2012-To get a whole array out, you still use $array[index1], but then you have to cast that as an array:  @{$array[index1]}.
2013-If you want to run this on a BSD, OS X or Linux system, make sure that you change "ps -ef" to "ps -ax" and "mailx" to just "mail".

           So, my favorite field is finally starting to produce fruit:  urlLink I Can See  ( urlLink Wired cover ).
2030-Ever since I read all 5 pages of this article this morning, my mind has been awhirl.
2031-First, the techology behind this is amazing.
2032-The camera, not amazing.
2033-The computers, not amazing.
2034-The software, not amazing.
2035-The neural implant, bingo.
2036-If you have read the article, you will know that this implant sits directly atop the visual cortex.
2037-The resolution is not that high, but it does allow the user to perceive objects.
2038-Second, I am rethinking my future plans again.
2039-Cybernetics is now, the proof is here!
2040-This is just the beginning, this is just what the public knows.
2041-I am sure that many of my dreams will be realized by the end of my lifetime (which should hopefully coincide with the end of this century).
2042-Why should I limit myself to basic computer support work my entire life?
2043-Why should I try to get an MBA and join the management track before I am 28?
2044-Technology and cybernetics are two true loves.
2045-Repairing vision (of this fashion) is simple in comparision to what is possible!
2046-Maybe I should have stuck with my plan to become a biomedical engineer.
2047-Too bad UMich didn't offer a BME undergraduate degree when I was applying.
2048-Third, I really want to watch  urlLink Ghost in the Shell  again.
2049-Never, under penalty of death*, should you order the clam chowder at Quizno's.
2050-*Death by viscous, oil-layer-covered, hard-clam-chunk soup.
2051-Best described as melted butter with ripped pieces of boiled spam.
2052-My  urlLink Fall 2002 schedule  is now available.
2053-All 400 level courses from here on out.
2054-When I meet someone new, eventually the conversation will turn toward basic formalities.
2055-One of these formalities is usually in the form of the question "What are you majoring in?
2056-", asked after they find out I am in college.
2057-My answer, "Biology and computer science.
2058-", is always countered with one of two responses:  ::Hesitation, look of confusion::  "Really...  That's different."
2059--OR-
           Another tool for my Hack Recovery Disk:   urlLink Busybox , a single executable that replicates much of the functionality of many GNU utilities.
2060-A new project I would like to work on:    A simple BSD or Linux boot disk that contains a few utilities for testing for a hacked box.
2061-Initially, the system administrator would boot off this floppy and run the initialization utilitity.
2062-It would take an MD5 hash of all the files in specific directories (such as /etc, /bin, /sbin and /usr/bin) and store the results in a text file.
2063-Later on, the system administrator could boot off this floppy again and run the comparison utility.
2064-It would take another MD5 hash of all the files and compare the results.
2065-Doing this in BSD would be easier for me because I have access to many BSD machines.
2066-Doing it in Linux would make it much more widely supported.
2067-Can the stock Linux kernel mount FFS file systems?
2068-I know OpenBSD can mount Ext2 file systems.
2069-Red Hat now uses Ext3 by default, so it would only work with older RH systems.
2070-Hopefully I will be able to create a boot disk that would work with most any unix system.
2071-This project could also use  urlLink Tripwire  or a  urlLink pre-made system disk .
2072-Or maybe I will just do it all from scratch just to be a jerk.
2073-Wow, I'll be damned.
2074-You know how I said there were two main singers for that crappy opening band, Cuda?
2075-Well, turns out, the guy with the better voice is Gar Wood from the Hot Snakes.
2076-I just thought the regular bassist was taking some time off, so the guy from the Cudas joined them.
2077-It's completely the other way around.
2078-No wonder I was so confused, and no wonder there was such conflict, and no wonder his voice is that much better.
2079-Ahh, for the want of broadband at home:     urlLink Hot Snakes live shows ,  urlLink slick Music Videos .
2080-Laura and I went to the Hot Snakes show last night at the Magic Stick.
2081-Neither of us had been there, so we had a bit of difficultly parking.
2082-We found the actual place just fine, but we had to settle for street parking a couple blocks away.
2083-To summarize the Magic Stick:  Hellhole.
2084-The main room isn't too bad, though a bit run down.
2085-The pool tables are all 7 footers, and are thus worthless.
2086-The bartender was quite the jerk, but what else would I expect?
2087-The bathroom was, by far, the worst of it all.
2088-Laura was so disgusted by the her bathroom that she wouldn't even describe it.
2089-The mens room had two stalls and two urinals, yet no stall doors or seats even.
2090-The funniest part was there was just a random roll of toliet paper sitting toward the middle of the room.
2091-Who would use that?
2092-No door, no seat, just a random roll sitting in the filth of many punks?
2093-I will pass.
2094-Strike one.
2095-I knew there were supposed to be two opening bands, but I figured they would start playing soon after the doors opened.
2096-We got there at 7:30 PM, the doors didn't open until 8 PM, yet we waited and waited and waited....
2097-The first band (Red Hot Legends) finally started at 9:30 PM!
2098-They sucked.
2099-Musically, not bad.
2100-Their vocalist, on the other hand, was so horrid that we couldn't understand a single lyric.
2101-Strike two.
2102-A good 40 minutes after the first band screeched to a halt, the second band (The Cudas) got on stage.
2103-Musically, pretty basic without flourish, melodical but plodding.
2104-The band had two main singers and a female backup singer/keyboardist.
2105-You could just tell the two guys were vying for top spot in the band.
2106-The guy who called the shots was a cheesy chach, the other guy had a much better voice.
2107-Gotta love band conflict.
2108-Their lyrics though, simply pathetic.
2109-Strike three.
2110-Finally, praise god, the Hot Snakes got on stage sometime after 11 PM.
2111-I am not even sure when they started, my eyes were watering because I was so over tired.
2112-Without any build up or chatting with the audience, they launched into I Hate the Kids.
2113-I was a bit unsure of their quality live at first, but then I think their sound engineer tweaked something.
2114-The sound was very faithful to the albums, but with pure raw energy.
2115-They also played 10th Planet, Automatic Midnight, If Credit Matters I'll Take Credit, Light Up The Stars, No Hands, Our Work Fills The Pews, Past Lives, Gar Forgets His Insulin, XOX, Who Died, Suicide Invoice and Ben Gurion (wow, I remembered almost all of them).
2116-Laura and I actually left during their show because I was so tired.
2117-Hopefully I didn't miss much.
2118-Luckily, I got to hear my favorite three songs (I Hate The Kids, If Credit's What Matters I'll Take Credit and Suicide Invoice).
2119-It's so hard to rock out when you have to get up before 6 AM the next day.
2120-The show was amazing, thus all strikes are taken back.
2121-You know what sucks about 60 gig drives?
2122-Defragging.
2123-And I thought acid was bad:  Laura's older sister Carolyn was housesitting/catsitting for some friends these past two weeks.
2124-15 days of this, which was supposed to end yesterday.
2125-Since the couple was supposed to be back last night, Carolyn went home.
2126-She got a phone call around 11 PM from the FIRE MARSHALL.
2127-It seems that the dryer caught on fire and burned up half of the basement.
2128-They found her cell phone number on a note upstairs and called her.
2129-Luckily the fire caused a water pipe to rupture, helping quench the flames.
2130-She was okay, the cats were okay, no one was hurt.
2131-More luck for that family.
2132-And I thought wasps were bad:  Laura works at the School of Public Health as a lab technician.
2133-The lab she works in deals with air purity/polution.
2134-The air and water samples they collect are stored in generic glass bottles.
2135-To insure that these bottles are free from impurities, they are washed in acid, baked in acid then cleaned with various other techniques.
2136-Just the other day, Laura was doing the usual routine of cleaning bottles when she accidentally dropped a bottle of acid into a sink.
2137-The acid bottle was open since she was using it, thus acid splashed up and into her EYE.
2138-She immediately used the eye wash, which I believe saved her.
2139-Though she could see just fine after it happened, she decided to go to the ER just to be sure.
2140-They flushed both eyes with a liter of saline each then examined the damage.
2141-Just a small amount of corneal abrasion which healed quickly.
2142-Thank god.
2143-Facts about  urlLink poop .
2144-If you work in an office environment, skip directly to the section on pooping at work.
2145-It is so true, especially the SAFE HAVEN.
2146-Can't view thumbnails in Windows 2000?
2147-Broken images?
2148-Happened to me, just need to  urlLink hack the registry .
2149-The things a boy will do for internet access:   As most of you know, I am back at my parents house for two weeks this summer.
2150-During this time, my only home net access will be dial up.
2151-This would be bearable if I could actually make a connection!
2152-I dial up my umich account and the connection will die within 20 minutes (usually after only 1 minute).
2153-I called up Ameritech and they said it could be a problem with the line, or it could be internal wiring.
2154-If the wiring was the case, then they would charge us just to come look at the problem.
2155-He suggested that I connect a modem directly into the interface on the outside of the house.
2156-Problem, my computer is in the basement.
2157-Luckily, I am sometimes smart.
2158-I found a phone cord long enough so that I could run it from the external interface, through the bathroom window and then *down* the laundry chute into the basement.
2159-Unluckily, the external interface is behind a  urlLink rose of sharon  bush (Hibiscus syriacus).
2160-Guess what likes to hang out around these bushes?
2161-Wasps!
2162-I got stung four times, including twice *in the face*.
2163-All for dial up access.
2164-Laura and I were discussing life plans and money.
2165-I came to the conclusion that I don't really need a new sports car when I graduate from college.
2166-She made the point that it would be better to waste a bit of money now than buying a 'Vette and a Harley when I hit 45.
2167-Thus:    urlLink   
           Sweet.
2168-An entire cup of cream of broccoli soup from Mr. Pita with a total of six (6) appreciable pieces of broccoli.
2169-Yes, I did count.
2170-Bad news:  My good-email-to-spam ratio is now below 1.
2171-For the past week, it is currently hovering at .8106.
2172-Good news:   urlLink SpamAssassin  lets me calmly ignore all of said spam.
2173-D'oh, I forgot to tell you *why* all of my projects have been aborted.
2174-I am resodding my parent's front lawn.
2175-It's a fireball of fun, I assure you.
2176-Here is a little list I whipped up of the steps I need to take to properly resod (reseed, actually) the lawn:   Remove all old turf.
2177-Test the composition of the soil.
2178-Add soil amendments to correct soil composition.
2179-Add fertilizer and till 6 inches of the soil.
2180-Level soil to a 1-2 degree grade.
2181-Water for 2 weeks to allow weed seeds to germinate.
2182-Remove weeds with Round Up.
2183-Lightly rake top of soil.
2184-Spread seed equally in two passes, the second at 90 degrees to the first.
2185-Lightly rake the fresh seed.
2186-Lightly roll the fresh seed.
2187-Apply a light layer of mulch.
2188-Water lightly (5-10 minutes) twice daily until lawn height is  inch.
2189-Water deeper (15-20 minutes) once daily until lawn height is 3 inches.
2190-Mow lawn to 2 inches with a sharp-bladed bagging mower.
2191-My current list of aborted projects:  Hack Check disk Image gallery Binary data from a MySQL database pulled by PHP  I have programmers ADD.
2192-Note to self:  "yellow tag" is another phrase for "Post-It note", at least to the English-challenged in my office.
2193-Things are finally falling into place:  I have sucessfully signed up for electricity, cable, phone and DSL for my new apartment.
2194-Ameritech, once again, is a bunch of asshats.
2195-A simple activation took an hour longer than expected.
2196-Let's hope their current special (DSL for $29.95/month, no install/activation fee) makes up for their asshattery.
2197-I don't have time to properly comment, but just read this  urlLink short story .
2198-It is extremely geek-heavy, I warn you.
2199-Even though I just  urlLink posted  about the Hot Snakes last week, I am already the 13th listing on google for the keywords  urlLink Hot Snakes show .
2200-Put that in quotes and I am  urlLink #2 .
2201-Woohoo.
2202-I am in the top 100 for just  urlLink Hot Snakes .
2203-Cannot ...  urlLink spin ... pen  ...
2204-So frustrating!
2205-As much as I hate using this page as a place to rant, sometimes it has to be done.
2206-The first assignment for my senior design project is due this Wednesday.
2207-Basically, it is a presentation that explains the requirements of the project.
2208-In order to do the presentation, we need to have a good idea of what the project will be.
2209-Since our project was pretty open-ended, that required meeting with the client (in this case, the biomedical engineering professor).
2210-Professors are busy people, and thus he could not meet with us until today.
2211-He found an opening in his schedule and emailed us at 11:15 AM saying he was free from noon until 2 PM.
2212-None of my other group members could make it, which is understandable given the short notice.
2213-Thus, I had to meet with the professor by myself, while still extremely sick.
2214-Luckily, I was able to be partially coherent and not spray snot all over his office walls.
2215-Since I am poor and car-less, I took the bus from north campus back to central campus after the meeting.
2216-There was one kid standing up in front of my seat while myself and the kid next to me were trying to get off the bus.
2217-I let the kid next to me get up first, then I started to stand up.
2218-When the first kid got up, the guy that was standing slid back and was directly in front of me.
2219-Without even looking above me, I stood up.
2220-I stood up directly into the guys elbow.
2221-Crack, right on top of my head.
2222-Now my leg and my head hurts.
2223-On top of still being very very  urlLink sick , I was woken up this morning at 5:45 AM with the most excruciating charley horse in my right leg.
2224-It probably only lasted 15 seconds, but it felt more like a minute.
2225-Here we are, seven hours later, and my leg is still in pain.
2226-I need to reboot my body.
2227-urlLink Trojaned OpenBSD CDs .
2228-Making your own ISO of OpenBSD is a trivial exercise.
2229-Hell, I make an i386 specific ISO every time a new version of OpenBSD comes out.
2230-You can still get the latest one  urlLink here .
2231-People buy the CD to support the project, and that's it.
2232-No one that has the technical knowledge to need/want/use OpenBSD would be unable to make their own CD.
2233-To all the people that bought this trojaned CD, installed it and got 0wn3d, you deserved it.
2234-urlLink TCP/IP Sequence Number Analysis .
2235-Instead of simply stating that Mac OS 9 has a very predictable TCP/IP sequence, there are graphs that show the spread of such "random" numbers.
2236-Very enlightening.
2237-A sinus infection has left me completely incapacitated.
2238-I had to skip class yesterday, and I may do the same today.
2239-I woke up this morning feeling like I had the worst hangover of my life.
2240-My stomach hurt, my head was throbbing and my muscles were sore.
2241-Yesterday, my nose was leaking like a burst water main.
2242-It was quite odd, minding my own business, playing on the computer, then feeling a hot river of snot pour from my nose with undying fury.
2243-The taste, that was what got to me the most.
2244-Today, my combination of ibuprofen, asprin, claritin, generic over-the-counter decongestant and antihistamine and mulit-vitamins might keep this sickness in check         
           I finally got my MDE project:   We run some large image processing tasks that run over many processors.
2245-We've developed our own code to distribute computations over several Unix systems, but it's really out of date.
2246-In particular, we need to take advantage of the compute power in Linux clusters.
2247-We have our own small cluster and we would liek to exploit the capabilities of the large cluster in the Center for Parallel Computing.
2248-One of my students provided the following request.
2249-I think this would make a great senior design project with real applicability in the commercial world....   How about a tool set for running background C code or MatLab jobs.
2250-Kind of like the launch program, but for use on our local Athlons.
2251-A script would detect what machines are idle and launch jobs in a joblist serially.
2252-Alternatively, and even better, they could get an account at the Center for Parallel Computing for the Athlon clusters.
2253-These clusters use SMP parallel computing additions to the C language.
2254-For independent C processes like our tracking, it would not be that hard to write scripts that modify the C code so it can run on these Athlon clusters, and maybe even automatically launch it and give feedback in the process.
2255-So users can run independent C code on these systems without having to learn the SMP additions or details about the parallel cluster.
2256-Automatic transfer of files without interactive authentication and big/little endian compensation may pose some challenges.
2257-This is a seriously under-developed project description.
2258-We are going to have a meeting with the professor that suggested this project to get some solid details.
2259-The cool part about this professor is that he works in the biomedical engineering department.
2260-My bio degree will make it easier to get in his head.
2261-I have another project to add to my list.
2262-Hopefully I will finish one of these this semester.
2263-For the sake of argument, I will define the "lifespan" of an operating system to be from the day it is released to the public (either for purchase or for download) to the time *two* new versions of the operating system have come out.
2264-An example would be  urlLink OpenBSD 2.9 .
2265-It was released on June 1st of 2001.
2266-Since  urlLink OpenBSD 3.1  (the second version past 2.9) came out on May 19th of 2002, the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9 was 06/01/2001 to 05/19/2002.
2267-Over the lifespan of OpenBSD 2.9, there were 27 different patches.
2268-That might not seem like much, but that is over two patches a month.
2269-For a company that has many servers, that could be a lot of patching.
2270-Likewise, the current version of OpenBSD (3.1) has 14 patches already.
2271-That version had only been available for under three months when the last patch was issued.
2272-Now that I have that cleared up, time for the actual project:  An OpenBSD version of  urlLink Windows Update .
2273-Since no self-respecting BSD admin would go to a website for their patches, BSDUpdate would be a command-line tool.
2274-It would check the current state of your system, verify which patches were needed, and download them.
2275-The tool can then install the patches and restart services as/if necessary.
2276-The tool could also be put in "automatic mode" and placed into a cron job for completely seamless updating.
2277-This is actually a very easy project (but also time consuming).
2278-Nevertheless, I will be damned if I ever finish it.
2279-School started this week, which is the main reason why my post frequency has dropped to near-zero.
2280-My classes for this term include Operating Systems, Molecular Biology and the Major Design Experience.
2281-Operating Systems is not as cool as I thought it would be.
2282-Instead of getting an overview of the 1.9 million topics involved with operating systems, we are only learning threads and file systems.
2283-So disappointing.
2284-Molecular has been good so far, which is surprising.
2285-By now, I thought I would be horrifically sick of anything biology related.
2286-I talked to someone new in class for the first time in practically three years, so that might help.
2287-And finally, the Major Design Experience (MDE):  8 credits for a single project.
2288-We were given something like 30 projects to choose from.
2289-We got to pick our top three, then the professors will put us into groups.
2290-My choices were:  Writing a set of UNIX/Linux tools to ease administration of a network that includes UNIX, Linux, Windows and Mac workstations.
2291-Add an extension to the university LDAP server so that email groups can have their list archived or sent as a digest version.
2292-Rebuild the EECS website, both the design and the database backend.
2293-I don't care which one I get, they should all be fairly easy.
2294-Time consuming, but easy.
2295-Once I get into the swing of things, I am sure I will be back to posting (almost) everyday.
2296-I don't even have a desk in my room yet, so it might be awhile.
2297-When people thing of Mac accessories, they think fruity colors and translucency.
2298-Not any more, meet  urlLink Hubzilla .
2299-*Still*  urlLink sick !
2300-You know you are a software engineering geek when:    An every day problem comes along, and instead of just trying to solve it immediately, you have to plan for it.
2301-"Well, we first have to figure out what the real problem is before we can solve it."
2302-Then you have a requirements phase, trying to figure out what will need to be done to solve the problem.
2303-Then you have a design phase, trying to come up with a good way to solve the problem.
2304-Then you actually do it.
2305-I need to spend more time with biology and less with computer science.
2306-It's pervasive.
2307-The engineering job fair was this week.
2308-I don't want to say much, but there were three companies that were quite interested in me.
2309-Two are on the West coast and the other is on the East coast.
2310-I don't think I am ready to move just yet.
2311-Real life is pretty scary.
2312-Sprint PCS sucks.
2313-There is a very good reason that the greeting on my phone has been Sprint POS ever since I got it.
2314-Let's go over what happened to me this month:  I moved from Ann Arbor to Livonia back to Ann Arbor.
2315-I changed my address on the Sprint PCS site about a week after I moved to the new Ann Arbor apartment.
2316-The changes just wouldn't stick.
2317-I would change the address, save the changes, reload and the old address would be back.
2318-I tried for about 3 days to get it to stick, no luck.
2319-Eventually, I just couldn't log into the website.
2320-I make all of my payments online, so this was going to be a problem when September 7th rolled around (my billing date).
2321-Obviously, that day blew past.
2322-I couldn't log into the website for a couple weeks and my bill was overdue.
2323-They didn't turn my phone off for a couple weeks, so I thought I was set.
2324-No so much.
2325-They turned it off yesterday.
2326-I STILL can't get into the website.
2327-This morning, I called their customer service number.
2328-I had to PAY $3 to get my address changed over the phone.
2329-That is strike 1.
2330-My new apartment is in the basement of a house.
2331-My cellular reception is extremely spotty and random.
2332-Sprint PCS rarely works in university buildings.
2333-My job, classes and main study area are all in such buildings.
2334-Thus, my cell phone only works when I am walking to and from my destinations.
2335-What cellular provider should I go with?
2336-Ever wanted to print a man page in unix?
2337-You can't simply pipe the output straight to a printer device, it just won't work.
2338-Most normal workstations will have a2ps installed, a tool that converts ascii text to a PostScript file.
2339-To print a man page:  man {someSubject} | a2ps -m -P {printerName}  To save a man page in PS format:  man {someSubject} | a2ps -m -o {fileName}         
            urlLink Metro VERSUS Festiva  this SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY...         
           One of the best  urlLink Slashdot  posts I have ever seen, it actually made me laugh out loud:  I can see it now; toe to toe late one night ata stoplight.
2340-One man revs his engines, the other responds with a growl of his own.
2341-The other prepares his mind for the upcoming duel, the other is hurriedly inputing up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a.....
2342-Original  urlLink here .
2343-More important than a new laptop, I got to see Elaine last night!
2344-She moved from Ann Arbor to Philadephia quite awhile ago, so it was great to see her.
2345-She was having dinner with a bunch of her friends from her last job, working at a comic book store.
2346-She was a bit concerned that I wouldn't fit in.
2347-Me, not fit in?
2348-I was just as geeky as the rest of them, it just didn't show as much...  Just kidding, they seemed like a great bunch of people.
2349-I would like to thank  urlLink IBM  for having such a crappy online ordering process that I have decided to buy from a different company.
2350-I would have purchased an  urlLink IBM Thinkpad R , but whenever I would try to pick the parts I wanted, the price would always be "NA".
2351-Maybe that means they are sold out of Thinkpad Rs, but they could have told me in a better fashion.
2352-Because of this set back, I might just buy a laptop from Compaq.
2353-If someone had told me last week that I was going to get a Compaq, I would have laughed my ass off.
2354-Instead, I have fallen in love with the  urlLink Compaq Presario 900 .
2355-As of right now, it is looking like I will be getting these specs:  Mobile Athlon XP 2000+  256 MB 266MHz DDR  30 gig hard drive  8x DVD drive 14.1" XGA Display  Built-in 56k modem and 10/100 NIC  The laptop is a bit beefier than my last one (1.5" thick and 6.8 lbs), but it shouldn't be a noticeable difference.
2356-Mmm mmm consumerism...
2357-Nothing like a 4.5 month hiatus to get the juices flowing.
2358-Expect updates to slowly build up over the weeks until a digital cacophony overwhelms all.
2359-As I  urlLink mentioned previously , I signed up for  urlLink EMusic  recently.
2360-In the first few days, I downloaded upwards of 1.8 GIG of music.
2361-If they are going to offer unlimited downloads, I'm going to take advantage.
2362-I've pulled down 49 albums so far.
2363-Some of the highlights:  Adult.
2364-Apples In Stereo Belle And Sebastian Built To Spill Etta James Pavement Sahara Hotnights The Hives  More will be coming.
2365-Maybe I should keep a list of all my MP3s since that list is growing so incredibly fast.
2366-But anyway, for only $9.95/month (for 12 months) or $14.95/month (for 3 months),  urlLink EMusic  is a great deal if your tastes are broader than mainstream.
2367-When it rains, it pours.
2368-I got an email today from a local Ann Arbor company in the medical field asking if I wanted to interview with them.
2369-The email said nothing about the position so I inquired about that.
2370-We shall see.
2371-Speaking of money, I just got an email saying I have another fly out interview.
2372-I don't want to say who it is with, but they are a computer company in the top 100 of the Fortune 500, in the top 20 of the Best to Work For and in the top 10 of the Most Admired...         
           Just this morning I told myself that I would stop spending money.
2373-In the past month, I've bought a new digital camera, work out shoes, a bunch of work out clothes, some regular clothes (but no more blue shirts because Leah says I have too many.
2374-Not possible!
2375-), and a subscription to  urlLink EMusic .
2376-I spent a lot of money going out, especially on food.
2377-So, I said no more.
2378-Then, I got a gift certificate in the mail for $15 at Express Men.
2379-Jamie and I went today and I said I was only going to spend enough to use up the gift cert.
2380-Not so much.
2381-I ended up spending $80 there and then $40 at Fields buying some new cologne (Pleasures for Men).
2382-I promise, no more.
2383-Hmm, speaking of working out, I never explained how accident-prone I've been over the past few weeks.
2384-I cut myself twice, once on a bagel when I was in a  hurry and once when chopping up peppers and I wasn't paying attention.
2385-The pepper cut, which is on my left thumb, was so deep that I probably needed stitches.
2386-I'm a dumb boy, so I just put a butterfly bandage on to seal it up.
2387-When working out at the beginning of spring break last week, I was walking on my hands (a relic from my pre-wrestling work outs) and stretched out my ACL in my right knee when I landed.
2388-Being a dumb boy, I played racquetball with Joe later that evening.
2389-I was attempting a spinning return when I realized there was no way I could land and put that much pressure on my right knee.
2390-I stopped midway but my racquet kept going.
2391-I smashed myself in the left eye.
2392-I should have taken pictures right when it happened, but here are a couple pictures from over a week after it happened:   Normal coloration   Photoshopped coloration to show bruise beneath the eye           
           My two hour American Values discussion just got cancelled, woohoo!
2393-I get to work out instead.
2394-Sitting in an overly-warm classroom discussing the people's reaction to the FDR fireside chats or lifting and getting a huge endorphin rush, you make the call.
2395-Texas toast does not taste like ass.
2396-Here is a quick recipe for cheesy bread I just whipped up:  Cheesy Texas Bread Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 8 minutes  Ingredients: Texas toast, sliced thick (3 slices) Shredded mozzarella or sharp cheddar cheese (1 cup) Grated parmesan cheese (3 tablespoons) Butter Garlic powder Italian seasoning Red pepper flakes  Directions: 1)  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2397-2)  Lightly butter the bread.
2398-3)  Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmesan onto the buttered side of each slice.
2399-4)  Season with garlic powder, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to taste.
2400-5)  Cover each slice with 1/3rd cup of shredded cheese.
2401-6)  Place onto an ungreased cookie sheet.
2402-7)  Cook for 8 minutes.
2403-Dannon Light n' Fit Creamy yogurt tastes like ass.
2404-Avoid it much like the polar bear avoids the Miami sun.
2405-Crazy dream #2:  Just a few days ago I had a dream that involved moving down to Georgia.
2406-Since I don't know anyone down there, I had to find housing by myself.
2407-All of the apartments were full or something so I ended up subletting a room in a mansion.
2408-The details of the mansion itself were fuzzy but there definitely was a pond in the back with some odd stones surrounding the perimeter.
2409-(It reminded me of a  urlLink Mandelbrot set , now that I think of it.
2410-Do you dream in fractals?
2411-Thought not.)
2412-The owner of the mansion and (what could only be) his young daughter showed me to a room.
2413-They said there was only one problem, the bed had been in the pond earlier.
2414-Eh, whatever, I took the room anyway.
2415-I fell asleep (in the dream) and woke up with two leech-like beings on my left hand.
2416-I immediately started to swat at them, trying to get them off.
2417-The owner and daughter (who must have been watching me sleep) yelled at me to stop and that these leeches would keep sucking until either they filled with blood or died.
2418-On closer inspection, the leeches had these coiled bodies that could expand and hold a LOT of blood.
2419-I had to get to the hospital, so I called Eric (who knows why he was in Georgia).
2420-He picked me up in some weird Dodge Neon-SUV hybrid (which can be explained by the fact that I fell asleep reading Motor Trend) and we tried to ask for directions to the nearest hospital.
2421-Everyone would give us directions, but different directions.
2422-Just as we got on the highway, I woke up.
2423-My entire left arm was completely asleep which explains the leech bit.
2424-Crazy dream #1:  Just after Leah and I started dating, I had a dream that I was MCing a talent show.
2425-It was held in downtown Detroit in a dingy, 70's-styled theater.
2426-I don't remember how it happened, but I ended up on stage and was told to MC the entire affair.
2427-I didn't know who was supposed to be in the show so I just talked to the crowd and made a game out of it.
2428-Rob Shereda was in the audience and I was under the impression that he was supposed to be the MC but decided to let me run it.
2429-After introducing the first act, I hopped down from the stage into the crowd.
2430-Everyone seemed to be dressed as if it was the 70's, but in that updated-yet-still-retro style.
2431-Leah was there and just as I was about to talk to her, I woke up.
2432-I have a new  urlLink digital camera .
2433-I haven't gotten many chances to use it, but it was put into full effect to capture a  urlLink typical night out .
2434-Check out the rest of the galleries  urlLink here .
2435-Hopefully that will quickly fill up with galleries from my tenth and final semester here.
2436-Last week was spring break and mostly it was spent at work.
2437-For those of you that haven't been dragged into the Daily by now, here is a  urlLink quick run down of the important areas .
2438-The  urlLink really big   urlLink black server  in that gallery is the old database server that I replaced last weekend.
2439-Other than work, I hung out with Leah as much as possible.
2440-We went up to State for a night and that would have been a prime candidate for picture taking, but I hadn't met 90% of those people yet.
2441-It's just better to not be "that guy that always has his camera" just yet.
2442-Here is some background as to what has been going on in my life the past 5 months.
2443-First, I am seeing someone new.
2444-Her name is Leah and to try to explain how perfectly the relationship is developing would be to spoil it.
2445-Expect to hear more about that later.
2446-Second, and related to the first, I'm no longer with Laura.
2447-Things were a bit rough at the end of last semester and she decided to end it.
2448-No hard feelings, on my part.
2449-Third, I will be graduating come April 25th.
2450-Fourth, I have no idea where I will be after said graduation.
2451-There is a job possibility down in Alpharetta, Georgia, but I won't be saying any more about that until I know for sure.
2452-Crazy euchre story:  Leah (on the other team) was dealing and turned up a bower.
2453-I was three-suited and called it up with NO TRUMP.
2454-We won that hand and won the game 10-0.
2455-Am I lucky or what?
2456-PROTECTION  Lock your door Zip up your jacket Take your vitamins Pull into your shell Load your gun Put on your sunscreen Arrest your terrorists Check your engine Pay your insurance Pop the pill Censor your media Cool your reactor Put on your life vest Buckle your seat belt Sterilize your tools Pray to your god Sign your contract Set your alarm But open your heart and mind Love is its own protection         
           Homework can wait.
2457-Tonight was the  urlLink Sarah Slean  concert!
2458-While I was checking out  urlLink other concerts , I saw that she would be playing at  urlLink The Ark  tonight.
2459-I knew that Jenn was a fan, so we decided to go.
2460-I had only heard a couple of her songs quite a while ago, but I figured it would be good to go to a concert anyway.
2461-I'm damn glad I went.
2462-Not only was it a good time with Jenn (and seeing Beth wasn't half bad), but the concert itself was so good it was inspiring.
2463-I really had no idea what to expect.
2464-When a gorgeous redhead (though fake, I think) took the stage with a vivacious and humorous stage presence, I knew this was going to be good.
2465-She has a good command over the piano, ranging from full-yet-harsh wailing to soft and melodic.
2466-Her voice takes a bit of getting used to, but she has some power when she wants to use it.
2467-Her lyrics were a bit obtuse for a first time listener, but that will surely correct itself over time.
2468-Interestingly enough, her guitarist was actually the most talented person on stage.
2469-He played four different instruments total, two electrics, one acoustic and one that could only be described as an electric tweleve-string ukulele.
2470-With the help of at least 12 different pedals, he added a depth to the music that would have left the piano naked without.
2471-All in all, a pretty kick ass show.
2472-Jenn bought her newest CD and quickly sent me MP3s of all the songs when she got home.
2473-This is definitely going into my permanent rotation.
2474-I hate that  urlLink fweakin' marshmallow .
2475-Another good workout followed by consuming way too much damned food.
2476-The last time I did this I ate a bowl of tomato rice soup, a ham and swiss on sourdough, a granola bar, a yogurt and two oranges.
2477-Today was another bowl of tomato rice soup, a veggie burger,  urlLink three pieces of cheesy bread , two huge oranges and a bag of pretzels.
2478-For lunch!
2479-I am glad that my goal of working out is better physical fitness and health, not overall weight loss...         
           Haven't heard much from/about  urlLink these guys  lately.
2480-Here is an  urlLink image gallery  from their latest tour in Japan.
2481-Sigh, so many concerts I want to see.
2482-Either there is no one to go with, or I can't get a ride, or they are just too pricey.
2483-Here is the short list:   Sparta (March 15th @ State Theater) Rocket From The Crypt (March 17th @ Magic Stick) Kodo (March 24th @ Michigan Theater) Sahara Hotnights (March 31st @ The Shelter) Adult.

           Current Reading: The Feminine Mystique, by Betty Friedan.
2486-I've just barely started reading and I'm already hooked.
2487-She describes the plight of the 1950s/1960s housewife so spot on and with such clarity, it borders on prescience.
2488-A quagmire of concrete, brick and sod, that is all a suburban home seems to me now.
2489-I need to live in a big city, at least until I have kids.
2490-Jamie, Alissa and I just tried  urlLink Potbelly  for the first time.
2491-Not bad!
2492-The sandwiches are tasty and hot and cheap ($3.79).
2493-Alissa tried the ice cream and that got a thumbs up, Jamie and I tried the cookies and they got a thumbs up.
2494-Big thumbs down on their fountain pop though.
2495-The cup was probably only 12 ounces yet it cost $1.39!
2496-For $1.39, you get a 32 ounce cup at Jimmy John's.
2497-I guess they have to make up costs somewhere.
2498-Newest albums added to my collection:  Drive Like Jehu - Yank Crime The Hives - Barely Legal Sahara Hotnights - Jennie Bomb Sarah Slean - Night Bugs Eminem - The Eminem Show Alkaline Trio - Goddamnit Apples In Stereo - Velocity Of Sound Descendents - Everything Sucks Built To Spill - Ultimate Alternative Wavers Aerogramme - Sleep And Release At The Drive-In - Vaya Belle And Sebastian - If You're Feeling Sinister         
           This has been a crazy week.
2499-The craziest part is trying to organize one of my interviews.
2500-When they initially contacted me a couple of weeks ago, they asked for 8 possible interview dates.
2501-I gave them 8 and then realized a few days later that one of those dates was the same as my AI final!
2502-Murphy's Law in full effect, they chose that day.
2503-I emailed my contact back immediately and asked if it could be rescheduled to any of the other days.
2504-The best she could do was to push it back a day, to April 25th.
2505-I have finals on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th and then commencement is on the 26th.
2506-Bad timing, eh?
2507-So, here is a rough estimation of my schedule for those three days:  April 24th   10:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Final Between 3 PM and 6 PM: Fly out of DTW Between 6 PM and 9 PM: Arrive Afterward: Crash at hotel  April 25th  6 AM: Wake up, get ready, find office 8:30 AM: Interview, interview, interview Between 9 PM and Midnight: Fly out  April 26th  Between 5 AM and 8 AM: Arrive at DTW 9:15 AM: Commencement  I can't believe I am taking the redeye from an interview to catch commencement.
2508-urlLink The Gulf War Two Drinking Game .
2509-Current Music:  "Bombs Over Baghdad" by Outkast         
           I've fallen in love with two older games lately:   urlLink Gran Turismo 3  and  urlLink chess .
2510-Yeah, chess is just a wee bit older.
2511-Basically, Joe tossed GT3 into the PS2 earlier this week for the first time since we've owned it.
2512-He has only played the rally races (since he hates all of the races on pavement).
2513-Matt and him scrapped for awhile and I tossed my hat into the ring.
2514-I was under the impression that to correctly navigate a turn you had to be turning the whole time.
2515-In rally, this couldn't be farther from the truth.
2516-You turn well before the actual bend in the road and then power slide through almost every one.
2517-I got smoked in those first few races.
2518-After they had left, I gave the course a few more runs.
2519-I just barely beat the course on "Easy" mode *then* I figured out turning.
2520-Each run saw my times improving after each iteration.
2521-Eventually, I was beating the CPU car by 10 seconds in "Hard" mode.
2522-That is when I got hooked.
2523-GT3 is an extremely deep game.
2524-Even the simplistic "Arcade" mode has 30+ tracks and too many cars for me to count.
2525-The simulation mode has a depth I haven't quite fathomed yet.
2526-You start off with a meager amount of money and no cars.
2527-My first car had a whopping 116 HP to start, which was pretty depressing since Zig had a car that was pushing 1048 HP.
2528-You can customize your car, earn driving licenses (that allow you to enter the more difficult races), and obviously race.
2529-I've just started, but I'm sure I am going to be hooked.
2530-On to chess.
2531-For some reason, Zig decided that all of his programming buddies should have a contest.
2532-He will write a basic GUI that allows people to plug-in two chess engines and have them go at it.
2533-I doubt I will participate (since writing a chess engine would take hundreds of hours, at least), but that got chess on our minds.
2534-After dinner (a Tuesday night tradition with the guys), Chris and I ran to the chess store at Briarwood and picked up a chess clock.
2535-We went back to my apartment and played four games:  Chris versus Matt, Matt versus Joe, Joe versus myself and then Joe versus Chris.
2536-None of the games ended with a checkmate since we were playing with the clock.
2537-The first game gave 15 minutes per person then we pulled that down to 10 minutes per game when Joe was playing.
2538-I just didn't pay attention to the clock and I ran out of time with the game probably only half way through.
2539-Speed chess just isn't my thing, but I at least didn't lose in less than 20 minutes total.
2540-Hopefully I stick with both of these games.
2541-I *knew* I was using that word incorrectly.
2542-Whenever I feel like I am giving up and letting someone else have their way, I might say something about " urlLink subjugating  my will" to them.
2543-In all reality, I have been meaning to say  urlLink abdicate !
2544-I could say something like "I'm just allowing you to subjugate my will", but that doesn't have the same ring to it.
2545-Say it with me: "abdicate my will", "abdicate my will" and "abdicate my will".
2546-Google supports wild card searching!
2547-Type in something like  urlLink "give me * or I'll kill you"  and Google will find all results that start with "give me ", end with " or I'll kill you" and have a single word in the '*' location.
1347-Sweet.
2549-Jamie, Joe and I hung out yesterday.
2550-We just absolutely had to enjoy the weather!
2551-The diag wasn't the most verdant place (the snow washes away yet everything is so dirty) but it was enjoyable nonetheless.
2552-We grabbed Jimmy John's on the way then sat by the flagpole.
2553-We mainly talked about the  urlLink night before  and how we wished it turned out just a little bit less dramatic.
2554-As always, we also discussed the future.
2555-I finally realized that Joe is going to be moving out of state no matter what happens.
2556-We didn't know each other too well until this year, but I feel we've gotten close.
2557-I'll miss him.
2558-Jamie and I discussed how cool it would be if we both do end up staying in the Ann Arbor area.
2559-I now have an official job offer from a company around here, so it just might happen.
2560-Of course I am still going to have my fly-out interviews.
2370-We shall see.
2562-My camera got some more use; check out the pictures from the day  urlLink here .
2563-Over the years, a few people I have known personally have started weblogs.
2564-Those are always the best because you know most of the basic information about their life anyway.
2565-The weblog is just another glimpse into their psyche.
2566-Well, just recently, Eric started his own  urlLink weblog .
2567-Another one of my good friends started one as well, but that is NOT for public consumption.
2568-Last night, Joe and I had planned a little gathering.
2569-It was going to start with pizza, then drinking/euchre/video games and then finally going to see the midnight showing of Batman at the State Theater.
2570-Well, the plans quickly changed.
2571-We started off playing spades, chowing down snacks and drinking beer.
2572-Eventually more people showed up so we got pizza, played some GT3 and broke out the hard liquor.
2573-When it was time to leave for the movie, we voted and decided it would be more fun to stick around.
2574-This is when the night started to break down.
2575-Somebody started getting pretty upset when we played Never Have I Ever, then another got upset because of sexual comments and then finally someone got violently ill.
2576-There is still a huge mixing bowl filled with puke and a blanket covered in puke in our bathroom.
2577-Other than that, it was great!
2578-See the pictures  urlLink here .
2579-Just the other day, an ex-girlfriend told me that she got married early last year.
2580-Just tonight, I heard that a friend from work last summer just got engaged.
2581-I'm a little freaked out.
2582-Hmm, let's see which is nicer:  ANN ARBOR, MI    ALPHARETTA, GA    REDMOND, WA           
              Only in Michigan is a 26 degree temperature drop normal!

2874-There are enough MP3s on my computer to listen for over a week straight and never hear the same song twice.
2875-Winamp says 183 hours, 14 minutes and 1 second worth of musical goodness is available.
2876-Since it is all on Kazaa, it is  available .
2877-If you have a second, do a search for my last name in Kazaa.
2878-Over 259 files showed up all because I embedded my name in the ID3 tag of some MP3s I ripped.
2879-These songs were ripped my freshman year of college and then placed on my FTP server.
2880-At the peak, this server got over 100,000 hits in a single weekend.
2881-It's fun to see that my files have spread across the globe.
2882-When I get older and I own a home, I will have a personal library.
2883-I'm not talking about a den that has a large shelf of books.
2884-I'm talking about a room devoted solely to housing books.
2885-If my (or my wife's) affluence accounts for it, the books will all be bound in the same color and style (not necessarily leather).

           Just so that everyone knows and that I do not forget,  urlLink Eric  is playing at the  urlLink Blind Pig  on April 1st, 2003.
2887-Also, it's a shame that I already have two sets of plans for this upcoming Friday because Athletic Mic League is going to be at the Pig.
2888-Benadryl =  bad.
2889-I've been taking Claritin for years now, at least since high school.
2890-Just recently, they came out with an over-the-counter form of Claritin.
2891-Now my health insurance doesn't cover perscriptions to Claritin and the OTC version costs $13 for ten doses!
2892-When my prescription to Claritin had run out at school and I needed something to tide me over until I made it to the doctor next, I would just get an off-brand  urlLink antihistamine/decongestant .
2893-When I went to the store to pick some up, they were all out so I decided to try the  urlLink Benadryl version .
2894-Not at good call at all!
2895-Some people take Benadryl just as a sleep aid and now I know why.
2896-I took two in the past few days and my sleep needs have gone up at least 25%.
2897-I even fell asleep in the car when Leah's mom was driving us back to Ann Arbor!
2898-I had to take a nap from noon until 2 PM today even though I got more than my normal amount of sleep last night.
2899-Does anyone need a sleep aid?
2900-I'm not taking anymore of these.
2901-I am definitely not a big fan of Star Trek, but I've been known to watch quite a bit of The Next Generation and some Deep Space Nine.
2902-Slashdot had an  urlLink article  about Enterprise and how Rick Berman is going to try to salvage it.
2903-The discussion about this article ranged from how Berman needs to be executed to reasoning why the first series were much better.
2904-Out of the blue comes  urlLink this comment .
2905-It is an idea for a new Star Trek show.
2906-The basic premise is of a cadre of special ops members of the Federation that take care of the dirty work.
2907-Read the comment.
2908-If it was shot in a dark, plodding, almost psycho manner, it could be a hit.
2909-If it turns into another wild cowboy show, it could fail.
2910-If the visitors of  urlLink Kempa.com  made up a list of best albums of all time, the concensus for the top spots would be: Radiohead - OK Computer : (9 votes) Weezer - Pinkerton : (7 votes) Beach Boys - Pet Sounds : (4 votes) Minutemen - Double Nickels On The Dime : (3 votes) Pavement - Slanted and Enchanted : (3 votes) Beatles - Abbey Road : (3 votes) Sloan - Twice Removed : (3 votes) Sadly, I do not have two of these albums (Abbey Road and Double Nickels On The Dime).
2911-I should fix that soon.
2912-Ok, now I have a bit of time to talk about my weekend.
2913-Thursday, I ended up going out with Jamie and Chris.
2914-I really think we have coalesced and get along great as a threesome now.
2915-That is depressing because Chris officially moves to Chicago on Wednesday.
2916-But anyway, we had a good time.
2917-We ended up going to Scorekeepers because of the enticement of $3 pitchers of Coors Light.
2918-We were surprised to find out that before 10 PM, there were $1.50 pitchers of both Coors and Killian's.
2919-Needless to say, we finished off four of them between 9 PM and 10 PM.
2920-Since it was a Thursday, the place was packed like Chinese in the SARS treatment office.
2921-I saw at least four people that I knew, possibly more.
2922-Friday was the  urlLink Compulsive Lyres  concert.
2923-I hadn't been to an a cappella concert in quite some time, even though I went often in my first few years here.
2924-The Lyres put on a great performance, as did the  urlLink Friars  and the  urlLink Maine Steiners .
2925-Not so great was the Indigo dance team.
2926-After being introduced, they were late getting on stage, couldn't find their places, had to reorganized everything on stage and then the music problems kicked in.
2927-First, there was a boom box on stage that was used as a prop by the Lyres.
2928-For some reason, the dance team thought their music was going to be played on said boom box.
2929-First they couldn't figure out how to turn it on, then they noticed that there was no CD in it.
2930-They looked around confused, got into their dance positions just as their music started  blaring  over the auditorium speakers.
2931-This was just the beginnings of their problems.
2932-Two of the girls just could not stay in sync which threw everyone off.
2933-Though there were many little kids in the audience, most of their music was about sex and filled with swearing.
2934-Needless to say, even though they were scheduled to dance during two portions of the show, they didn't return.
2935-After the show was the Lyres after party at Colonial lanes.
2936-It was a Rock 'N Bowl night, which actually turned out to be quite fun.
2937-Jamie, Alissa, Bri and I bowled a couple of games and none of us broke 100.
2938-Somehow, Jamie found a way to bowl that required her to clench her left butt cheek for balance.
2939-Her butt was sore for days afterward.
2940-We all had fun while bowling, but things got a bit tense early in the morning.
2941-Saturday, Chris and I hung out for most of the day.
2942-His back is pretty messed up, so we went to the doctors first.
2943-The rest of the day was spent playing video games (Tekken 4 and NWN).
2944-That night, Jamie, Zig, Eric, Matt, Kristin and I went to Charlie's and then back to Jamie's place.
2945-Things got a bit crazy at Jamie's since I ended up putting Crisco in Zig's mouth at one point.
2946-I thought it was maybe 1 AM when I finally went to bed but Jamie informed me later that it was closer to 5 AM.
2947-Whoops.
2948-Anyway,  urlLink here  are the pictures from that night.

2950-I don't have much time to tell you all the details about last night, but here is the  urlLink image gallery .
2951-Leave it to Ann Arbor to be one of the  urlLink most overpriced places to live !
2952-I'm back from my first interview trip!
2953-Here are the  urlLink pictures .
2954-Funny picture from the car rental place,  urlLink 404: Car Not Found .
2955-It's a shame that someone already has  urlLink my   urlLink car  at the company I interviewed with.
2956-I will try to post a bit more before I go on the first of my interview trips, but I at least needed to point out the  urlLink pictures from Mat's surprise party .
2957-There are actual  urlLink pictures   urlLink of   urlLink Leah !
2958-Bwahahaha, the  urlLink Wings got swept in the first round ?
2959-It just seems so comical!
2960-Even with a cast of (current, past, future) All-Stars like Yzerman, Federov, Shanahan, Robitaille, Hull, Lidstrom, Chelios and Joseph, we got swept in the first round.
2961-It doesn't matter how good you think the Ducks are, the fact is that we were swept.
2962-None of the games were blowouts, but even that fact is inconsequential.
2963-Since we can't rely on the Lions or the Tigers for championships, I guess it's up to the  urlLink Pistons  now!
2964-Don't worry, I won't be moving to Georgia anytime soon.
2965-Today is the final day of classes for my undergraduate career.
2966-I have a 8-10 page research paper due in 30 hours.
2967-As of now, I have one paragraph.
2968-Yay, procrastination!
2969-Sorry for the lack of posts lately, the end of the semester is hitting hard.
2970-Yesterday, the weather was gorgeous, so Leah and I took a walk through the Arb.
2971-Afterwards I made dinner and subsequently felt extremely tired.
2972-She ran off to a few group meetings and it was time for me to study for the rest of the night.
2973-The combination of the weather, working out, taking a walk and a full meal wore me out, so I decided to make some coffee.
2974-I haven't had large amounts of caffeine since I gave it up at the beginning of this year.
2975-I drank half a pot in about an hour and a half.
2976-Let's just say that was a horrible idea.
2977-I started to get pretty wired an hour in, but I figured that would be the only symptom.
2978-I was so wrong.
2979-My concentration started to wane, I was getting dizzy and then it got worse.
2980-Eventually, I just wanted to either run around the room or puke.
2981-I had to dry heave for a good five minutes until I could stand up again.
2982-I got probably a good half an hour of work done between midnight and 3:30 AM when I finally fell asleep.
2983-88 degrees today and 39 degrees in only two days?!
2984-I really ought to move out of Michigan.
2985-I do realize that I will be graduating in three days, but I keep forgetting all of the little details that this entails.
2986-Last week, I had my final class and final blue book exam.
2987-This week, I wrote my final paper.
2988-Tomorrow will be my final exam.
2989-This is slightly overwhelming!
2990-A lot of things are going to be different when I graduate.
2991-There are many little advantages I take for granted, like student pricing on tickets and all of the computing access I get from the university.
2992-I need to figure out what I'm going to do for a primary email address!
2993-I will probably move over to something like mike@bibik.org soon.
2994-But where should I host it?
2995-I don't want to pay for hosting, I am leaving the Daily soon so I can't use their servers and my home server doesn't have a static IP.
2996-Oh well, that might be the least of my worries.
2997-More later, but for now, it's time for my second-to-last final!
2998-I dreamed that I finally bought the  urlLink Z .
2999-How utterly pathetic is that?
3000-Dreams are a vessel of idyllic imagery or gut-wrenching iconography, not a venue for a materialistic wank.
3001-Once again, I'm using this site to store infomation I would otherwise forget.
3002-In a Slashdot article about air filtration, someone  urlLink posted a very inexpensive way to filter a whole room .
3003-Just attach some polyester air filter material (the poster suggested 1" thick Blue Tint) to a large box fan.
3004-Seems simple enough, especially in a room with a generous amount of ambient noise (read: a server room, or my room since it has two loud computers and a fan already).
3005-I  urlLink graduated .
3006-More later.
3007-Let's see, where to begin...  First, the interview from a week and a half ago!
3008-I can't divulge much information, for two reasons:  1)  I haven't gotten a yes or a no from said company.
3009-2)  I had to sign an NDA before I could talk to anyone.
3010-Let's see how many details I can give away without giving it all away.
3011-First, I was told that I would have anywhere between three and five interviews total.
3012-There ended up being a total of six, which I can only interpret as being a hopeful sign.
3013-I arrived at the recruiting building (yes, an entire building devoted to recruiting) around 8 AM and didn't end up leaving until around 6 PM.
3014-Given a half hour for lunch, that was practically nine and a half hours of interviewing!
3015-Second, the riddles asked were fairly interesting and though I might have heard them all before, I had never solved any of them.
3016-The first one wasn't so much a riddle as a generic design question.
3017-I was asked how I would design the timing on any given traffic light.
3018-I was allowed to request whatever information desired and then I had to come up with some formulas for making the "best" traffic light.
3019-The first part of the problem was how to define "best".
3020-What makes a good traffic light?
3021-I decided it was a combination of two factors:  1)  Maximum throughput in all directions.
3022-2)  Low traffic jam incidence rate.
3023-After figuring out the formula for a single intersection, I had to modify it for a grid of intersections.
3024-Then I was asked to "think outside the box" (yes, that phrase was used exactly) and figure out other ways to improve the experience.
3025-All in all, a basic design problem.
3026-The second riddle was a programming question, something I didn't expect to encounter since I was interviewing for a management position.
3027-Managers don't code!
3028-I was given a 2D array and had to figure out the time it would take to sort it.
3029-I barely remembered performance numbers for the different sort algorithms, but I remembered that quick sort was O(n log n) (and thankfully was correct).
3030-Sorting a 2D array would thus take (O(n log n))^2.
3031-The second part to the programming question was how to sort two already sorted linked lists.
3032-This was simple, since you just setup two iterators that would move along the two lists, removing the smaller of the two items.
3033-The riddle I had the hardest time with was the cube desk calendar.
3034-You have two cubes and you are allowed to put any single digit on any face.
3035-With these two cubes, you have to represent every number from 01 to 31.
3036-This turned out to not be that difficult when I realized you could mathematically approach this and define restrictions.
3037-Some examples of these restrictions are that you need a "1" on each block since you have to represent "11".
3038-The same thing for "2" and "22".
3039-Eventually, I got to the point where I had six open spots on the cubes but seven numbers to put on the cubes.
3040-This is when I realized that you could use "6" to represent a "9" and thus solved the puzzle.
3041-Almost all of the riddle had a mathematic basis.
3042-The next riddle started off as a word problem.
3043-A man starts at point A on a mountain and walks up to point B in exactly 12 hours.
3044-At some time later, he walks down from point B to point A in exactly 12 hours.
3045-He does not have a constant rate of ascent or descent.
3046-The actual riddle was "Can you prove or disprove the existence of a point P where the man took the same amount of time to reach the same spot on the mountain?"
3047-I was having trouble trying to prove this, since it had to be true.
3048-Eventually, I was given a hint to use a graph.
3049-First I tried plotting time versus distance.
3050-That was dumb.
3051-Once I plotted time versus location, I showed that the plots must intersect and thus a point P does exist.
3052-The last riddle was one I heard a long, long time ago.
3053-I knew the answer, but didn't know how to explain it at first.
3054-This was the "Let's Make a Deal" riddle:  You have three doors to choose from, 1 with a prize and 2 without.
3055-After you choose your door, the host of the show will eliminate one of the doors you did not choose and then ask you to pick again.
3056-You can either stick with your original door or choose the remaining door.
3057-The question is, do you stay or do you switch and why?
3058-I knew you were supposed to switch, but couldn't think off the top of my head why.
3059-Finally I realized that your initial chance at winning was only 1 in 3.
3060-After the elimination, your chance is at least 2 in 3.
3061-Switching is smart.
3062-Ok, that was the first of more updates.
3063-I gotta run now though.
3064-Ok, everyone has been bugging the hell out of me to post, so here comes a barrage of updates.
3065-I've added links to both  urlLink Night 04.28.2003  and  urlLink Chicago 05.01.2003  image galleries.
3066-Here are the apartments I'm looking at in the Redmond, Washington area:  WARNING: You need to have a free Rent.com membership to view these links.
3067-urlLink Cedar Terrace Apartments   urlLink Sammamish View Apartment Homes   urlLink Overlook at Lakemont   urlLink Park at Forbes Creek   urlLink Ravenswood   urlLink Archstone Inglewood Hill   urlLink Archstone Redmond Campus   urlLink Archstone Redmond Hill          
           Well, it's official.
3068-I've been waiting a long time to post anything of substance because I knew a decision would be coming soon.
3069-I'm now officially a Program Manager at Microsoft on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Division.
3070-I will probably be moving out there between the end of June and mid-July.
3071-I'm not sure yet.
3072-There is so much I want to accomplish before moving, so many people to see and say goodbye to, it's overwhelming.
3073-Today, I went car shopping.
3074-I think I found the one I want, but it's a bit pricy for someone who won't be seeing that first pay check for at least two months.
3075-I could wait, but I want it now!
3076-::whine::         
           Uh oh...
3077-The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Eigth Level of Hell - the Malebolge!
3078-Here is how you matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   Extreme       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   High       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very High       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Extreme       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Extreme       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   High       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Extreme       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Extreme      Take the  urlLink Dante's Divine Comedy Inferno Test           
           Well, I chickened out.
3079-I didn't buy  urlLink this , I bought  urlLink this  instead.
3080-Instead of leasing a car for three years, I'm buying it over three years.
3081-I'm also saving myself hundreds of dollars a month in payments and insurance.
3082-I guess I'm happy with this responsible decision.
3083-Mmm mmm, nothing like a good one month hiatus to get the not-so-creative juices flowing.
3084-Where to start...  Well, obviously, I started working at Microsoft!
3085-The move out was emotional, if not uneventful.
3086-The flight went fine, I got my month-long rental car just fine and I got into my new (temporary) apartment just fine.
3087-Jenn so gratiously gave me a Gamecube just before I left.
3088-That worked out perfectly because all of my stuff had already been packed to be shipped to the Seattle area so I had to take the GC on the plane.
3089-If it wasn't for the TV and the GC, I probably would have died of boredom those first four days.
3090-Imagine being in apartment without 99% of your belongings in a new city where you don't know anyone.
3091-It was worse than I can describe.
3092-Yeah, I cried off and on those first few days.
3093-There are so many people back in the SE-MI area that I miss!
3094-Once I got through those first few days, life improved.
3095-I got into a routine of waking up early and going to bed early to prepare myself for work.
3096-I drove around town getting myself used to the area.
3097-One big thing I've noticed is the marked difference in driving patterns.
3098-Five over the speed limit is the most I've seen someone without a radar detector do.
3099-Most people drive slower than the speed limit!
3100-This could be because everyone is used to the traffic...
3101-I swear to god it has to be some of the worst in the US.
3102-The area is surrounded by water and mountains so the highways are not as plentiful as possible.
3103-It's also difficult to widen any of the existing highways.
3104-There are simply too many people and cars for the area.
3105-They do have HOV (carpool) lanes, but it seems that very few people can take advantage of them.
3106-I think I might start carpooling just because no one else is.
3107-Some of the on-ramps are metered (meaning that there is a light that will allow only one car through every few seconds) but allow open access to the HOV lane.
3108-I've also decided to change my car choice because of the traffic.
3109-What's the fun in a  urlLink sports car  if you can't take advantage of it?
3110-It's also possible that I will have a substantial commute, so gas mileage might be a big concern.
3111-I also haven't chosen a city to live in, let alone an apartment.
3112-Lots to do in the next couple of weeks!
3113-As for the job itself, I'm really not sure how much I can say.
3114-I have a much better understanding of what I will actually be doing though!
3115-From what I can tell, I will be a bug wrangler.
3116-Basically, I will help the developers and testers eliminate bugs from already-released products.
3117-Hotfix, updates, service packs, stuff like that.
3118-Also, my title has changed in the past two weeks: Program Manager on the Critical Response Team in the Mobile Devices Product Group.
3119-They changed from MDD (Mobile Devices Division) to MDPG (Mobile Devices Product Group).
3120-I was told this is a common occurance and not to stock up on business cards since they will be out of date before I get them.
3121-I can't tell anyone my phone number or office number since they are supposed to change in the next two weeks.
3122-The entire group (MDPG) is being shuffled around to better coordinate the smaller groups (like CRT).
3123-If there is one thing I don't like about the job (yeah, already!)
3124-is that there are no set hours.
3125-Basically, if you are in the office in time for meetings and you get all of your work done, you can work whatever hours you want.
3126-Because of this, everyone has the mentality that they need to work 12 hours a day to look productive!
3127-The first day (Monday), I simply told my boss that I was leaving when I had finished all of my day-one work.
3128-He said that was okay.
3129-Today (the second day), I ended up staying for 11 hours.
3130-I got in around 7:30 AM, which is about 2.5 hours before most of the office gets in.
3131-When 4:30 PM rolled around, I didn't think it would look right to leave.
3132-The office was still packed!
3133-I need to go to a car dealership tomorrow around 5 PM and the dealership is 30 minutes away.
3134-I'm going to have to leave before 4:30 PM.
3135-I don't care what it looks like, I'm working hard.
3136-I was given a simple to-do list for the next two days and I've already finished it.
3137-I'm doing well, so far!
3138-Anyway, that is all I have time for right now.
3139-I still don't have my company-issued laptop and my two computers from home haven't shipped yet, so I have resorted to checking my Umich mail from the local library.
3140-Hopefully this all gets rectified soon.
3141-I miss you all!
3142-Stuff to buy:  urlLink Quiet CPU Fan   urlLink Home Theatre System   urlLink 27" TV   More to come.
3143-Added links to new image galleries:    urlLink My going away party ,  urlLink my graduation party , and  urlLink my new car .
3144-A lot of you know that Joe and I never returned bottles when we were living together in Ann Arbor.
3145-What few of you know is just how MANY bottles we acquired over the 9 months that we lived there.
3146-We filled an entire closet: 708 bottles total!
3147-Not bad, eh?
3148-Added pictures from the  urlLink Fourth of July .
3149-I guess I really should add some content other than just pictures...  On the Fourth,  urlLink Lee ,  urlLink Ben ,  urlLink Russ  and I went over to  urlLink Mark's  place for a BBQ.
3150-A few other people stopped by, friends of Mark and Lee's from Umich.
3151-We started cooking the meat before we realized that we didn't have any BBQ tools.
3152-A few of us ran to the store and picked up a set, but that was after we had already melted a plastic spatula trying to remove some hamburgers.
3153-We cooked and chatted for a few hours, then decided to go to downtown Seattle for fireworks.
3154-Russ and I took his car and Ben and Lee took Lee's car.
3155-Let's just say that it was a case of the blind leading the blind.
3156-Once we found where we were supposed to be, the traffic was unbareable.
3157-It took us at least an hour to find parking, then another 30 minutes to walk to the park.
3158-We met up with some other people just in time for some snacks and then the fireworks started!
3159-The show wasn't terribly eventful; the Livonia fireworks were almost as good.
3160-Afterward, most of the group was going to bars down in Pioneer Square.
3161-Our group dwindled down to Lee, Ben, myself and a guy named Matt.
3162-Neither Matt nor Ben wanted to go to the bar and Lee and myself are fairly laid back, so we succumbed to their will.
3163-Instead of the bars, we went to 7-11 for slurpees then to Krispy Kreme for 18 donuts.
3164-Pretty lame, but it was actually pretty fun.
3165-That's a bit more than a typical night with the guys, but we are hanging out quite often.
3166-They are a fun bunch, and this is really helping me adjust to the Seattle area.
3167-I will never forget the people back in the Ann Arbor - Livonia area yet I'm glad I've met some people out here.
3168-You like us, you really really like us!
3169-Info:  "And this is Microsoft at its best--building development platforms that allow companies to create new classes of applications that change the way we think about and use technology."

           Ever need to change your MAC address for AT Broadband / Comcast in the Seattle area?
3171-Just set your web proxy to be sas.r1.attbi.com, port 8000 and make sure that you have *.r1.attbi.com set as a local address.
3172-Go to that same site and you can change/add info.
3173-So, I opened up a  urlLink bank  account today and less than ONE HOUR later they call me up asking if I want to upgrade my account.
3174-Lovely!
3175-"Looking on the bright side of things, the Focus (or rather, Markkos Focus) confirmed it has the potential to win every rally remaining this season, gravel or asphalt.
3176-Even a rival team boss ruefully commented: 'the Focus is probably the best car at the moment.'
3177-Praise indeed."

3179-here in the US...           
           Why does Treetop's Berry Juice contain pear juice, apple juice, grape juice and finally raspberry juice?
3180-I mean, I guess it's  not  false advertising since they didn't call it Berries Juice; There is just a single berry.
3181-When the front says "Berry from 4 fruit concentrates", I would imagine 4 berries concentrates, wouldn't you?
3182-urlLink Pictures  from my birthday!
3183-From now on, all cell phones without some PDA functionality will be referred to as dumbphones.
3184-That is all.
3185-I just googled my site for  urlLink Stair Dismount  and I can't believe I never blogged it before!
3186-There is a new version called  urlLink Truck Dismount  which takes the premise of Stair Dismount (define a few variables, launch the dismount and see how much damage the body takes) but instead of stairs uses a moving truck and a few ramps!
3187-I really shouldn't be playing this at work, but it's terribly addictive.
3188-It has a good mix of complexity and ease of entry.
3189-The complexity is a time sink because you keep tweaking things trying to create bigger crashes and more damaging launches.
3190-Ok, lots more pictures!

Red: The color of my bathroom Blue: Sky Green: Grass Pink: Cotton candy Purple: Underwear (what can I say; I'm a freak) Black: The Evo I almost bought White: Shoe laces Sheep: Wool Dog: Stench Cat: Buster Winter: That soy sauce stuff that UMich used one winter to remove ice and snow but ended up staining all of the buildings Summer: Driving Spring: Laying out in parks Autumn: Running through leaves School: Textbooks Church: Weddings Socks: My stuffed drawer full of them Friends: The meaning of life  * Last question... Did you have fun filling this out?
3355-It was a great way to kill time at work         
           Jeff and I have started an actual honest-to-goodness workout routine.
3356-We are shooting to work out at least 5 times a week (more depending on work load and possible visitors) and we are going to track our progress.
3357-Currently, we take a notebook with us to record the exercises, weight and reps.
3358-When I get back to work the next day, I update an Excel spreadsheet with the data.
3359-I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the information, but never fear.
3360-I'm a huge dork; I'm bound to make charts and graphs representing our progress.
3361-Since we also play racquetball every day, we sometimes don't get enough time to do as many exercises as desired.
3362-Yesterday we were able to get through bench press, leg press, rope tricep pushdown, lateral pulldown, left and right obliques, hamstrings, and abdominals.
3363-In the past two days, I found out that a lot of people still check this site at least a few times a week for updates.
3364-Maybe I should give the people what they want!
3365-More pictures!

           I think I'm going to adapt certain automobile terms from the UK.
3367-Here are some proposed changes:  Hood = Bonnet Tires = Tyres Gas = Petrol Sedan = Saloon Wagon = Estate          
           My car has barely 2,300 miles on it and I already have to make an insurance claim.
3368-I was driving on 520 from my apartment to the good Target in Redmond.
3369-I'm following behind a Red Ford Expedition at a decent distance.
3370-Out of nowhere, I see that he is about to run over a 4'x4' piece of plywood.
3371-The SUV drives directly over it so that it goes between his wheels.
3372-The downforce air pressure from the SUV causes the wood to fly up into the air.
3373-It flips slowly and at just the right angle so that when I PLOW into it, it is like hitting a wall.
3374-Most of the board shatters into hundreds of car-scratching pieces but one 1.5'x1.5' chunk sticks to my bumper since I'm driving 60 MPH.
3375-I pull off to the shoulder, slow down, the piece slides down and I run it over (possibly causing unseen tire damage).
3376-I just called the insurance agent and thankfully it will be covered.
3377-Unfortunately, the adjuster is booked until next Saturday and I will have to pay my $250 comprensible deductible.
3378-Oh well, I'm not that upset.
3379-If I had bought a sports car, I would have been a bit peeved.
3380-Here are some  urlLink pictures of the damage :   urlLink Front drivers side bumper   urlLink Bumper close up 1   urlLink Bumper close up 2   urlLink Hood close up           
           It looks like the  urlLink second expansion for Neverwinter Nights  is going to finally resolve some serious issues with the game (especially issues Chris has with the game):  Lack of a kensei => New prestige class, weapon master Inability to see much of a playing field => Unlocked camera, meaning you can swing the view around to just about anywhere in the hemisphere above the floor around the character Boring henchmen => New scripting elements including romance Two character party maximum => Ability to bring along two henchmen          
            urlLink Its your birthday.
3381-Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
3382-How do you react?
3383-: Questions asked of San Fransisco mayoral candidates taken from  Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep .
3384-Beautiful!
3385-The questions make more sense in the book than the movie because of the greater explanation of how a human should/could react to the questions and what a replicant would do instead.
3386-urlLink Motorola picks an operating system  : "If Motorola is launching something, it ought to suggest that the software has passed the technical hurdles."
3387-Hell yeah our software has passed the technical hurdles.
3388-Just wait until you use a Smartphone; you will be hooked!
3389-So, the trip to New York City   my first time, actually.
3390-Ive been to a few large metropolises before:  Detroit, San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, Seattle, Orlando and Toronto to name them all.
3391-NYC is completely different from all of them and it starts with the ambiance.
3392-Starting out in Times Square had to affect my perception dramatically, though.
3393-The overall feeling that spewed from the city wasnt the common perception of impatience, snobbery or discourteousness, but one of surging energy.
3394-As Leah said, there is just so much to the city given that there are so many different sectors, each with its own life force.
3395-Time Square was bursting with this power because of the sheer vivacity (tactless extravagance) and curiosity (aimless tourists).
3396-We also visited the rest of midtown, much of the upper East and West sides, downtown and even touched some of the NYU campus.
3397-Blast to the fact that I didnt have my camera that night:  there is a cube almost identical to the one on the UMich campus!
3398-The only difference is that theirs didnt spin.
3399-As Leah and I noticed it and walked near, someone hopped out of the car at a red light.
3400-He scampered over the cube and tried to give it a push.
3401-He hopped back into his car and then gestured to his passenger that he knew of a cube that rotated.
3402-I yelled to him The one in Ann Arbor spins, eh? and he looked back, slightly bewildered and replied in the affirmative.
3403-Since Leah had just turned twenty one the previous week, we hit a few bars during the trip.
3404-She had received a few suggestions from coworkers and with the power of Pocket Streets on my Pocket PC, we hunted them down.
3405-First problem:  one of the bars was called Bowery.
3406-When I pulled a Find Place, it found Bowery alright.
3407-It wasnt until we were in the heart of Chinatown with no one around that I realized that it found a street called Bowery and had simply shown me the centermost location on that street.
3408-We used the Pocket PC to locate the nearest bar she had been recommended, headed in that direction, but ended up going to the closest bar we saw.
3409-It was called Pioneer and wasnt too bad of a place.
3410-It was only 11:30 PM and while the bars in Ann Arbor or Seattle would be full at that time, NYC bars are open until 4 AM and dont seem to swell until 1:30 AM.
3411-There were about 25-35 people inside total, but you couldnt tell by the noise level.
3412-The DJ was blaring a mix of old and new dance (pop mostly) though no one was dancing and everyone had to yell over the music to hear each other.
3413-Nonetheless, we had fun.
3414-A few (expensive) drinks later, our tongues were looser and we both learned something.
3415-Though I paid $7 for a shot, that wasnt anywhere near as bad as $26 for a Woo Woo (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) and a Cosmopolitan when we saw Cabaret!
3416-Cabaret was the first show we saw, but it did pale in comparison to Long Days Journey into the Night.
3417-Jon Secada as the MC?
3418-He can sing, but he cannot dance or act.
3419-The actress that played Sally (Melinda Karakaredes (sp?))
3420-did more than an admirable job.
3421-I had seen the 1972 version of Cabaret with Liza Minelli, but I do believe that I fell asleep through part of it.
3422-I could follow the story well since I had seen the movie, even if I couldnt understand some of the lyrics of some of the songs.
3423-Long Days Journey into the Night was our first idea for the trip.
3424-It was closing weekend, Leah had heard nothing but good reviews and it had Brian Dennehey *and* Philip Seymour Hoffman!
3425-Even though those seem like bigger names to me, it was Vanessa Redgrave that stole the show.
3426-She had a much more difficult role to play and she absolutely sold it.
3427-It was a character piece, and thus I was a huge fan.
3428-Hoffmans role seemed small and insignificant at first, but then the final scene changed all of that.
3429-Read the book or watch the movie to see what I mean.
3430-The three museums we hit (Met, Whitney and Guggenheim) simply reinforced my ideas about art.
3431-If it does not show technical ability or is not visually appealing (very subjective), then its worthless.
3432-I still dislike watercolors and most modern art, still like primary colors, pale orange and brown against white and silver, Mondrian and Rotko, Meiji period Japanese art, geometric abstraction and period fusion (example:  an series of WWII-style Japanese bombers in the shape of an infinity symbol over a burning current-day mid Manhattan done in the style of Edo period Japanese room screens using mother-of-pearl inlay and gold).
3433-I probably spent more time in museums in the past four days than I have in the past 10 years combined.
3434-No complaints.
3435-Well, thats it.
3436-Pictures to come.
3437-It seems that my website isn't responding for some of you.
3438-For me, it just takes awhile to load.
3439-Odd, posting about everyone not being able to see my posts...
3440-If you need a quiet CPU fan for an Athlon:   urlLink Thermaltake Silent Boost .
3441-urlLink Worst Jobs In Science : "I was a teenage stool-sample analyzer.
3442-Well, not me, but my old roommate was.
3443-He thought this type of job would help him get into med school (it didn't).
3444-His biggest complaint was people who turned in tightly-sealed (naturally) peanut-butter jars packed full of the stuff, which would (naturally) decompose producing gas, causing a literal shit-storm when opened.
3445-He only needed about a teaspoon-full to do the analysis. "
3446-I'm a  urlLink healthy   urlLink motherfucker .
3447-I stepped on the scale a couple of days ago and I'm now pushing 195 pounds.
3448-I was 192 pounds last week so those three pounds are driving me nuts!
3449-I'm working out a lot and definitely gaining muscle mass, but my fat levels are not decreasing.
3450-I should add more cardio to my work out.
3451-urlLink So true!
3452-The site seems to be operating at 100% efficiency again!
3453-I'm not exactly sure what caused the slowdown, but my suggestion to my website admin is what caused the latest problems (eg  urlLink gallery  was broken)!
3454-I noticed that the log files for apache were reaching sizes larger than 1.3  GB , so I suggested rotating the logs.
3455-When apache was restarted, it was mistakenly restarted in chroot mode (a security feature that we don't really need) and that broke just about everything.
3456-My  urlLink home dir website  was down,  urlLink gallery  was down, etc.
3457-Another quick email and things are back up again!
3458-This is, officially, the  urlLink world's ugliest phone .
3459-Holy cow crap in a bag; I've added more photos!
3460-A  urlLink single new picture  in the  urlLink 350Z gallery  (mmm, Liquid Aluminum....) A graph of relative  urlLink car brand quality  New galleries   urlLink Night 09.20.2003   urlLink Snoqualmie 09.21.2003   urlLink Cougar Zoo 09.21.2003            
            urlLink So great .
3461-If I ever get a nice car and an office where I can see said car parked (RE:   not going to happen here since I park in the underground lot), I might just print some of these out if a crap car parks next to me.
3462-Seems like the jerk thing to do; seems fitting for me.
3463-Damn you, AT Wireless.
3464-So the new Smartphone is finally coming to market and it is being heavily marketed.
3465-AWS is going to have a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal on launch day and everything.
3466-The new phone is being sold for under $300, which is actually a great price point for the hardware and services being offered.
3467-The device is being sold internally to Microsoft at a 45% discount, which is also amazing.
3468-The problem is that AWS plans are so expensive!
3469-Internally, the two plans being offered are $76/month and $95/month for 700 and 1,100 voice minutes respectively and 30 MB of data.
3470-That is just WAY too much.
3471-I thought spending $50 on my Sprint phone was overkill.
3472-For unlimited data and 1,100 voice minutes, the price jumps to $109!
3473-Come on.
3474-Also, get this, those are the Microsoft discount rates!
3475-For 1,100 minutes, it is normally $120 without data!
3476-I feel like screaming.
3477-No cellular service is worth that much.
3478-Ugh and double ugh.
3479-My current project at work has proved next to impossible and the deadline is being to peek over the horizon.
3480-Basically, I need to categorize various bug fixes.
3481-The difficult portion of this project is that I'm given the updated source code for each bug fix but the report needs to know the final location in our image of these fixes.
3482-From what I've seen, there is no way to trace a source file to the eventual binary file in the image.
3483-I thought I had a good idea to build the image, apply the changes, rebuild and see which files changed.
3484-I did that to a very small bug fix and 10% of the files changed (~1000)!
3485-I figured that had to be wrong so I compiled the full image, made no changes then compiled again.
3486-I saw that roughly 10% of the files had changed again.
3487-This is going to be tough to figure out.
3488-A few nights before she left, Jamie and I made a  urlLink great   urlLink dinner .
3489-Nothing quite like steak, red skin garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli and a bottle of Pinot Noir!
3490-I'm starting to enjoy wine for quite a few reasons:  If it isn't cheap, it almost always tastes good.
3491-There are thousands of varieties and I have yet to find a (non cheap) bottle that I didn't like!
3492-It complements the flavors of so many foods.
3493-I'm not going to start drinking it with pizza and burgers but it works with most everything else.
3494-Maybe it's just my lack of wine drinking experience, but that stuff hits me hard!
3495-Two glasses of wine has the same potency as six beers to me.
3496-I enjoyed the first Max Payne enough to complete it twice (which is quite the rarity nowadays), so I've had some interest in  urlLink Max Payne 2 .
3497-From the screenshots that were released early on in the development cycle, I wasn't too excited.
3498-Now,  urlLink gameplay videos  are available and they have definitely changed my tune.
3499-It's like they took all of the good aspects of the original game and improved upon them.
3500-Bullet time looks cool and useful, unlike in the first game where it was a necessary evil.
3501-Another thing I just noticed is that the object physics seem to be even better than the UT2K3 engine!
3502-Someone recently asked me to suggest a digital camera to these specifications:  Small/compact Expandable memory (at least up to 512 MB) 3x optical zoom 4 megapixels My suggestion turned out to be for the  urlLink Canon PowerShot S400 .
3503-After looking around for cameras, I realized that the S400 is smaller and has better resolution than my S30 and costs the same price new.
3504-Silly technology improvements.
3505-While whale watching, I encountered the only problem I have with my camera:  weak optical zoom.
3506-Considering that the optical zoom on my S30 is only 3x and very few consumer-level digital cameras offer anything greater, I think I will have to stick with it for now.
3507-urlLink EMusic.com  is  urlLink changing drastically .
3508-Gone are the days of 2000 downloads a month for $9.95 (well, $14.95/month for 3 months).
3509-I  urlLink had a subscription  and I'm now glad that I cancelled it.
3510-The new plan is $9.99/month for 40 downloads or $14.95/month for 65 downloads.
3511-Given that Emusic.com mostly carries indie, most of my downloads were hit-or-miss.
3512-I'd try something out just because they suggested it and sometimes it was great but more often it was deleted.
3513-Now that the downloads are so restricted, usage patterns are going to be changed drastically as well.
3514-The site should be euthanized.
3515-Wow, the Wings season begins  urlLink tonight !
3516-Being out in WA now, I'm curious as to how many games I'm going to be able to catch.
3517-Tonight's game is on ESPN2, but I have flag football practice at 6 PM and the game starts at 4:30 PM (PST).
3518-I'm curious as to how the goalie situation is going to work out and how Hatcher is going to fit in with our team.
3519-I doubt we are going to win the cup, but I'm still going to follow the Wings heavily.
3520-Since Seattle and even WA doesn't have a hockey team, I'm completely allowed to root for the Wings!
3521-I'm remembering at least portions of my dreams every night this week.
3522-Last night I know that I got stung by a bee on the left side of my torso, but that's all I remember.
3523-I can't find my favorite Windows Media Player 9 visualization!
3524-For some reason, I'm almost positive it was just like Battery:sepiaswirl but with color.
3525-Gah, something so simple yet it's driving me nuts!
3526-I guess Ambience:warp will have to do in its place.
3527-Ok, so in light of the  urlLink car rental fiasco , I decided to add car rental coverage to my insurance.
3528-I got a bit curious as to what my insurance rates would have been had I purchased a different car.
3529-I used Progressive's online quote service and got some interesting numbers.
3530-Note, the quote I got for my car was $1,439 while in all reality I pay about half of that.
3531-For comparison purposes, I'm going to take $700 from each of the numbers I got.
3532-That should be more realistic:   2003 Ford Focus ZX3 2003 Ford Focus SVT 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sedan 2003 Subaru Impreza WRX Sport Wagon 2004 Mazda RX-8 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 2003 Nissan 350z 
           Alright  urlLink Lindsay , let's see if I can match your dream posts.
3533-The first dream I had was more of a nightmare.
3534-Basically, two shady guys were going door to door trying to sell Smartphones to people.
3535-They had about 40 of the phones just tossed into a big plastic box.
3536-I don't remember actually letting them into the house, but all of a sudden they were both in my parents kitchen trying to sell us AR11s.
3537-As a side note, the  urlLink AR11  is our most hated device.
3538-It would never see a retail market because it has so many problems.
3539-Anyway, at first they were lackadaisically trying to get us to each buy a phone.
3540-It seemed that they were both very tired, worn out and just wanted money.
3541-It also seemed as if all the phones were stolen, obviously.
3542-When we refused to buy a phone, they started to argue and yell at us.
3543-Eventually, I took things into my own hands and started to beat on the leader of the two guys.
3544-I didn't hurt him too much and suddenly he was gone.
3545-I shoved his companion out the door and he rested against a parked car.
3546-Now this is where it starts to get weird and will be hard to imagine.
3547-So picture that you are looking out the door of a house onto a driveway.
3548-From your vantage point, you can see just the backend of a car parked in the driveway.
3549-The second bad guy that I tossed out of the house was leaning against the car, facing the door.
3550-He wasn't looking directly at me, but basically looking at the ground.
3551-He seemed exhausted and looked to be resting a bit before moving on.
3552-Suddenly and without warning, you see just a glimpse of the first shady guy come into the picture as he drops an axe down on the skull of the second guy, practically cleaving it in two!
3553-For some reason, I busted out of the house and ran past both the man wielding the axe and his now-dead accomplice.
3554-I felt that I was being chased a bit and then I felt everything had changed.
3555-I looked around, and the man with the axe was now laying on his back on the hood of a different car.
3556-His axe seemed to have bashed him directly in the face.
3557-I focused past that and saw my mom's friend Evelyn holding a smoking gun!
3558-I can only assume that while he was chasing me, she shot him in the back, he fell back onto the car and then his axe fell onto his face.
3559-I woke up after that one.
3560-The second dream is fairly hazy, but I know some details.
3561-The scene was the last day of class in presumably high school.
3562-It was more like a boarding school because not only did we have to clean out our desks and say goodbye to students and teachers but we had to pack up our bedding and clothes as well.
3563-I'm sure this has something to do with me reading so much Harry Potter lately.
3564-I know there was some crying and there was a dark haired female teacher that we were all sad to say goodbye to.
3565-The next thing I know, I'm getting married!
3566-I don't remember much of the details, but it seems that in the dream I had a wedding and got married to Jamie, then we divorced, then I was getting married to someone else not a month later.
3567-Weird.
3568-Ok, let's play with some numbers.
3569-Here are the current  urlLink WRC  standings:  (57 pts) Richard Burns (55 pts) Sebastien Loeb (53 pts) Carlos Sainz (48 pts) Petter Solberg (43 pts) Markko Martin (38 pts) Marcus Gronholm  Burns is on a downward slope.
3570-If his performance in Italy is any indication of his desire to win the championship, we can all but write him off.
3571-Expect Burns to score maybe 8 more points over the last three rallies.
3572-Loeb is hot now, but he is also inexperienced.
3573-His car is sick, so if he can avoid a major retirement in Britain he is going to pull down at least 15 more points.
3574-Sainz is too experienced to drop out of this championship without a fight.
3575-He won't partake in any major gambling, but he will be consistant.
3576-I'll give him 12 points.
3577-Petter knows he needs to score some serious points to vault into the championship, so he will twist his natural talent into desperation.
3578-At least two early retirements will keep him below 8 more points in the final rallies.
3579-Markko is going to destroy the next two rallies.
3580-Expect a first and a second place finish.
3581-The final rally in Great Britain is going to decide this championship.
3582-Gronholm has retired from the last three rallies.
3583-Expect another two retirements with a third place race to finish off the season.
3584-The final standings and points:  (70 pts) Sebastien Loeb (69 pts) Markko Martin (65 pts) Carlos Sainz (64 pts) Richard Burns (56 pts) Petter Solberg (44 pts) Marcus Gronholm  You heard it here first.
3585-Deciding to change my own oil may have been a bad call and I haven't even done it yet!
3586-After calling around to four different oil change shops in the area, I decided to do it myself.
3587-The cheapest I found was $25 and that was at a place I wouldn't trust.
3588-I ran to Napa auto parts and purchased six quarts of Mobil 1, oil filter, filter wrench, funnel, shop rags and wheel ramps.
3589-$70 in initial costs and an estimate of about $31 per additional oil change means I'm going to spend more money to do it myself!
3590-Granted, the prices that I was quoted for an oil change was not for synthetic oil.
3591-I guess it is more respectable to change your own oil...   nah, I screwed up.
3592-Car update:  So, you all know about the damage to my car ( urlLink original condition ,  urlLink information ,  urlLink damaged condition ).
3593-For some reason when I signed up for auto insurance, I didn't elect to add rental car coverage.
3594-My thought was simply that I doubt I will ever need to make a claim and if so it would only be for a couple of days.
3595-I figured that if I needed to rent a car, paying for two days wouldn't be so bad.
3596-Sigh, such stupidity.
3597-I took my car in two Mondays ago (09/22/2003) and expected to have it back by Wednesday.
3598-When I dropped it off, they said it would be done by Friday at the latest.
3599-Oh well, what can I do, I need a car so I will just pay for 5 days.
3600-Friday rolls around and the car is not ready.
3601-That sucks because the shop is closed on the weekends meaning at least three more days of renting the car.
3602-Monday comes and the car is not ready.
3603-Tuesday comes and the car is not ready.
3604-Finally I pick up the car on Wednesday (10/01/2003) and they got the wrong fog lamp in so that wasn't replaced.
3605-Total charge for renting a car for ten days:  $375!
3606-All because I didn't want to pay the $60/year for car rental coverage.
3607-Dan owns a timeshare on a plane; a plane!
3608-Man, I really need to learn to save my money.
3609-Endurance races in Gran Turismo 3 are a bitch!
3610-The easiest one, im my opinion, is the Roadster race.
3611-All of the cars are stock roadsters, so it's fairly easy to get a useable car from the start.
3612-I used a Mazda LS with super-slick (AKA high-endurance) tires.
3613-It took over 70 minutes to complete 40 laps, but I demolished the competition!
3614-I lapped everyone and almost double lapped the slowest car.
3615-There are four possible cars you can receive after winning this race (F688/S F1, Mazda Miata, Mazda Miata 1.8 RS or Mazda Miata RS) and of course I got the worst one (the plain Miata).
1657-Sigh.
3617-urlLink Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Review for PC at GameSpot .
3618-Jeff and I were going to split the cost of a copy, but then he realized his computer couldn't handle it.
3619-Looks like I'm flying solo!
3620-The combined score for my flag football team thus far is 9-184 (0-42, 0-28, 7-35, 0-51 and 2-28).
3621-Pathetic!

3623-Comments later.
3624-Update:  It looks like this is definitely going to be the prototype for the next NSX.
3625-It's a shame that Honda is probably going to keep HP in the sub 400 range, and probably closer to 300 HP.
3626-It coulda been a monster.

3623-Comments later.
3629-Update:   That is a link to a new model of Miata.
3630-A lot of people get into car racing through Miatas, so I'm keeping an eye on new model developments.
3631-I can't really fit into one, so it won't affect me.
3632-Another night, another crazy dream though I can only rememeber a few details from this one.
3633-Basically, I was a spy and my boss was the developer lead for my team.
3634-My first task was to assemble a disguise that would let me infiltrate the ranks of my target.
3635-It required some sort of black cape, weird black boots, a wig and makeup to look like an old woman and four old, silver coins.
3636-I started to assemble this disguise and eventually realized it would not work and came up with a different one.
3637-I had on tight black pants, black dress shoes, a beige collared sweater (sort of like this  urlLink one  but with a collar) with the collar up.
3638-Now that I had my disguise (if you can even consider that a disguise), I had to infiltrate the target location.
3639-From my surroundings, the locale was possibly the city of New York, but checking my maps showed St. Petersburg.
3640-So, yes, I was infiltrating a Russian installation.
3641-From here, the rest of the dream is very fuzzy.
3642-I do remember getting onto an elevator and having a woman roll her eyes viciously.
3643-I do remember some of the emotions that I felt.
3644-When I was performing the first task, I knew that I was taking shortcuts and that my boss would be upset if he found out.
3645-I believe the same thing happened when I was actually on my way to the base.
3646-I was using some sort of device to track my location (probably a  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered device, naturally) and that was against the rules of engagement.
3647-So in the past two weeks of flag football, my team has lost 58-0 and 28-2.
3648-Last week, my QB didn't remember how to hand off the ball and I plowed into him.
3649-The starting QB and the starting RB, plowing directly into each other.
3650-Too bad I was the taller of the two as my nose connected to his forehead.
3651-The blood started flowing immediately.
3652-This week, I jammed my middle finger on my right hand before the game started.
3653-That wouldn't have been that bad but I was starting QB!
3654-I couldn't feather out my floating passes like I wanted to and the team can't catch bullet passes.
3655-I gave up five interceptions, I believe.
3656-I just realized that I have never attended class drunk.
3657-Oh well, there is always grad school!
3658-About a week ago, I sent out an email to just about everyone in my address book that didn't live in Washington.
3659-The email outlined my new contact info for both home and work and that's about it.
3660-Well, some people didn't seem to appreciate this information: From lwashnoc@yahoo.com Date: Mon, 6 Oct 2003 18:04:05 -0700 (PDT) From: Laura Washnock-DiPietro   To: mbibik AT umich DOT edu  Mike,   I want you to stay completely out of my life, that is, after all, why I broke up with you.
3661-This means that I do not want to hear from you and I do not want you contacting, in any way, my friends and family.
3662-Trust me, they do not want to hear from you either.
3663-I did not email you earlier because I did not want to talk to you.
3664-I don't care about your new address and phone number.
3665-I don't care about your new job.
3666-In short, I don't care about what you are doing with your life.
3667-I also do not care for you to know what is going on in my life.
3668-If you are looking for closure, here it is.
3669-I broke up with you because you made me miserable.
3670-You were emotionally abusive and controlling.
3671-You put me down and made me feel stupid for being myself.
3672-When I broke up with you, I was too afraid of you to be this direct.
3673-I am not anymore and I am sick of you trying to weasel your way back into my life.
3674-Leave my friends alone.
3675-Leave my family alone.
3676-Leave me alone.
3677-Laura  Seeing as how a regular reply might not be appreciated either and I always need to get the last word in, here is my open letter of reply: Laura,  First off, relax.
3678-We have not talked since the beginning of this  year.
3679-I sent two emails over that period of time inquiring about your  well-being.
3680-I love how that is considered me trying to weasel my way  back into your life!
3681-I send an email to everyone in my address book about  my new contact info and this is the reply that I get?
3682-That is just a bit  dramatic!
3683-Twice you mentioned leaving your family and friends alone.
3684-I can only  assume that you brought this up because they received the same contact  info email as you did.
3685-Had I known that would upset them so much, I  definitely would have reconsidered sending it to them!
3686-Sarcasm aside, I  will not trust you when you say they don't want to hear from me.
3687-A few of  your friends didn't like me while we were together and I'm sure a few more  switched sides when you broke up with me.
3688-I do know that certain people,  including at least one sibling of yours, think differently.
3689-You may have  requested that they all shun me but that cannot affect their true  feelings.
3690-Who is being the controlling one now?
3691-It's a shame that you  cannot trust them to make their own decisions.
3692-I made you feel stupid?
3693-I'm sorry; I must have acted as a mirror of some  sort, allowing you to see yourself for who you truly are.
3694-It does not take  much for someone whose only intellectual hobby is to watch VH1 for hours  on end to think of themselves as being stupid.
3695-Try reading a book.
3696-Better yet, try challenging yourself!
3697-Outside of your required courses,  did you take anything difficult in college?
3698-I know you didn't make it  into the honors program, but there are some difficult classes offered to  the rest of the school as well.
3699-So, you broke up with me so that I would stay completely out of your life?
3700-Is that how it works?
3701-Why is it that so many other people have the ability  to break up and at least be cordial?
3702-Actually, if I remember correctly,  you have no contact whatsoever with any of your exes.
3703-Why is that?
3704-Do you  understand how to forgive people?
3705-Are your emotional abilities so  black-and-white that once you break up with someone, all emotion toward  them must turn to hate?
3706-Do you even understand how to separate the  concepts of friend and significant other?
3707-Hopefully you will learn with  Alex.
3708-Hey, he was one of my good friends back in elementary school.
3709-He was  probably one of the main reasons why we broke up and still I do not hate  him.
3710-Forgive and forget.
3711-Here is my take on the situation as a whole.
3712-You met Alex while we were  together and while our relationship was having problems.
3713-Having a small  shred of morality, you knew that you couldn't cheat so you decided to  break up with me to be with him.
3714-Though we did have problems, there was  still some good in the relationship.
3715-While you were with Alex, you had to  channel that emotional energy somewhere.
3716-The easiest emotion to channel  into is hate, so there it went!
3717-It is much easier to hate someone with  support from people you are close to so you slandered me enough to gain  this support.
3718-When you saw my latest email, you felt a slight twinge of  interest but you had to kill it.
3719-Instead of forgiving and forgetting, you  redirected that twinge into the anger spewed forth in your email.
3720-For that  emotional outburst, I applaud you.
3721-Even if I am completely wrong, know that you have now proved yourself as  the paragon of emotional puerility you were destined to become.
3722-M.          
           My apartment complex is comprised of four seperate buildings that share a single underground parking garage.
3723-When Russell and I moved in, we took two of the last parking spots available.
3724-They were over by building B while we lived in building A but it is just a short 30 meter walk across the garage.
3725-Last night after working out, I followed another car into the garage.
3726-They parked over by building A while I parked by building B.
3727-We crossed paths as we went to the opposing building.
3728-I didn't think anything of it, but she called out to me just as I was about to enter the building.
3729-We traded contact info and decided that we should trade parking spots.
3730-She was quite attractive as well; maybe that is why I didn't say anything in the first place.
3731-I no longer like investing.
3732-MSFT posts improved earnings and profits, beats the street estimate by a cent and our stock goes DOWN $2 the next day.
1657-Sigh.
3734-Hmm, factoring in employer contribution, my 401k currently has a return of 57.02% and my stock currently has a return of 32.03%.
3735-I like investing!
3736-As of today,  urlLink Windows Mobile  powered  urlLink Smartphones  are available in the US!
3737-urlLink AT Wireless  is carrying the  urlLink Motorola MPx200 .
3738-This is a monumental leap forward for my department.
3739-We have been working on the Smartphone platform for years and we are now in the US market!
3740-The AT site is selling the phone for $299, but until 10/28/2003,  urlLink Amazon  has the  urlLink phone for $149.99  (after $150 mail-in rebate).
3741-It is difficult to explain just how powerful these phones are in words.
3742-First off, it's a great phone.
3743-Reception is rarely an issue, audio quality is fantastic and all the features of a regular phone are there.
3744-Combine that with a full-fledged PIM (calendar, contacts, tasks, email), MP3 and video player, Internet Explorer, MSN Messenger, and more!
3745-An additional feature that not many people know about is you can use most of these phones as a wireless modem as well!
3746-Anywhere you go with your laptop, just connect your phone with the provided USB cable and now you are on the internet!
3747-The longer I am in this department, the more I love the products.
3748-urlLink BBC Top Gear : "I'm told that on a track, any track, the [Focus] RS is faster than a Subaru Impreza.
3749-Better looking too, but that's not hard."
3750-Haha, I'm starting to agree with all the reports about the looks of the Impreza.
3751-Sorry, Jeff and Joe, it really doesn't look all that hot.
3752-Then again, I almost bought  urlLink this  and even I know it looks like crap.
3753-My god, look at the travel on this  urlLink suspension !
3754-The wheels have to be a good 8-10 inches away from their default height.
3755-The expansion pressure on those shocks must be enormous.
3756-urlLink Seems   urlLink like   urlLink fall  in  urlLink Seattle  (taken from my balcony).
3757-Oh, yesterday's flag football game?
3758-We lost, 52-7.
3759-So last night was the  urlLink big go-karting event  at  urlLink Champs Karting .
3760-Racers:  Katherine, Russ, Jeff, Jeff's sister, Jeff's sister's boyfriend, Lee, Mark, Andy, Kevin, Joel, Dennis, Rob and another Jeff.
3761-It's a shame that Champs online results system is broken because then I could give actual speed numbers.
3762-At Champs, each race is 18 laps and because of the staggered start, the winner is whomever has the fastest single lap.
3763-I raced with Katherine, Mark and Lee.
3764-Mark set the fastest lap of the night (for our group) with a 20.00 flat.
3765-Lee was second with a very close 20.03 and I was third with 20.30.
3766-The track was fairly small but I didn't fully figure it out until about half way through.
3767-As you can see on  urlLink this map , there are a few hairpin turns.
3768-The worst was turn 3.
3769-No matter what I did, I couldn't seem to get enough exit velocity.
3770-If it was a real car, I would have changed the gear ratios for faster low-end acceleration.
3771-I figured out how to gain some serious velocity through turns 1 and 2, but 3 was my down fall.
3772-I'm sure another go at it and I would improve by at least .3 seconds a lap.
3773-Overall, I think everyone had a good time.
3774-Jeff and crew had to leave early since they had just gotten in from across the country that morning.
3775-His sister honestly looked like she pulled two all nighters.
3776-You know that glazed, watery look?
3777-She had a textbook case.
3778-Jeff will probably drag me back there, no worries.
3779-Afterward, Katherine, Russ, Lee and I went to Belltown Billiards.
3780-We were supposed to meet up with Lee's friend Craig, but he never showed.
3781-Everytime I go to the bar, I can never think of a cool mixed drink to order.
3782-I need to work on a list.
3783-So, Katherine works in pharmaceutical sales.
3784-One of the greatest accomplishments in this field is to get one of your drugs into regular rotation at a hospital.
3785-Basically, once the drug has been accepted by the hospital, smaller practices near the hospital will pick it up.
3786-Once it's spread through one area, other hospitals may pick it up soon after.
3787-Getting a hospital to accept your drug is no easy process.
3788-A representative doctor will get drilled about all the details on a drug for hours on end in front of a huge committee.
3789-Kat's father is a cardiologist.
3790-By basically his idea, his impetus and his work, he got one of her drugs approved at the local hospital.
3791-The hospital was not in her territory, so she knew that some of the credit would naturally fall to the territory owner.
3792-Last night after a hard day of work, she got home and checked her email.
3793-Her boss sent out an email to the entire west coast staff including her great great grandmanager.
3794-The announcement basically gave 110% of the credit to this other person and practically put Kat down!
3795-The wording of the email stated that this other person did all of the work, Kat basically helped the morning of the final presentation (implicating that she was late with the work and lazy) and gave very little credit to her father.
3796-Naturally, she was appalled.
3797-It's going to be hard to repair all of the damage that single email has done.
3798-I suggested it was time to start becoming a backstabbing, credit-grabbing bastard like the rest of her coworkers.
3799-So, I decided to add a car to  urlLink my list :   The Porsche 911 Carrera.

3801-urlLink AutoWeek - Car News : "Mitsubishi trimmed 146 pounds of nonessential items from its already-stellar Lancer Evolution for even more performance.
3802-Those items include the wing; HID lights (replaced with halogens); rear wiper; air conditioning; ABS; power motors for the windows, doors, locks and side mirrors; the entire audio system; trim in the trunk; vanity mirrors; rear assist grips; map lights; lots of sound-deadening material and even that little piece of leather wrapping that goes around the parking brake lever."

           How to create an OpenBSD 3.4 ISO:  Download the requisite files from  urlLink ftp://ftp.openbsd.org .

3816-I need to cut caffeine again.
3817-As stated in this  urlLink survey , my sleep requirements went from 8.5 to 5 hours when I quit caffeine.
3818-I wasn't exactly sure if it was the lack of caffeine or the dramatic increase in exercise that was the cause of the change.
3819-Now that I'm still working out just as much (or more) and I'm back on caffeine, my sleep requirements are back at 8.5 hours.
3820-It wouldn't be such a bad thing if I wasn't falling asleep at inopportune moments...

3821-So I'm back to including a bit of cardio into my exercise regime.
3822-On Tuesday, Jeff decided he wasn't up for racquetball so we did 30 minutes of cardio before lifting.
3823-I hit the elliptical for that entire time, burning over 400 calories.
3824-Lifting directly afterward felt so much different than normal where we start with lifting.
3825-Basically, every exercise seemed at least 15% more difficult.
3826-Anytime I have to grunt through an entire set of bench presses, I shouldn't be doing that much weight (nor does anyone actually want to hear me grunt).
3827-Last night, Jeff had two futbol games to play with his MS club so I hit the gym alone.
3828-Again, 400 calories on the elliptical.
3829-Many people have commented on my increased size (I've assumed musculature so far since most of these people wouldn't say "Man, looking a little pudgy there, Mike!
3830-"), but I feel that all the added muscle mass is simply pushing the existing fat out farther.
3831-I'm almost tempted to scale back lifting in favor of cardio, but then I wouldn't be making progress in strength.
3832-I've added at least 25 pounds to my bench since we started working out at the end of the summer.
3833-Maybe I should just get liposuction and keep lifting!
3834-When ordering a corduroy schoolboy jacket, I really wish online sites wouldn't shorten my order to "corduroy schoolboy".
3835-I have some decency, honest!
3836-I would never order a schoolboy if he was from Couduroy.
3837-urlLink FCC allows home numbers to be switched to wireless phones - Nov. 11, 2003 :  When I first read this article, I thought "Great!
3838-So many people will love this feature."
3839-Now that I really think about it, how much use is this really going to get?
3840-Ever since cell phones became popular, adding a new phone number became a routine occurance.
3841-It is not that big of a deal to change a phone number.
3842-I could have a skewed viewpoint because almost everyone that has my phone number also has an email address.
3843-Everytime I changed phone numbers (which happened every year in college and once again when I moved out to Washington), I've sent out an email announcing the change.
3844-It could be much more difficult for other people that do not have an alternate form of communication.
3845-I can see this being used by people that ran a business line in their home.
3846-They can keep the same number, which is probably on business cards, websites, etc but now have it tied to a mobile phone.
3847-Since I work in the mobile phone industry, any way to get more people to switch is fine with me!
3848-I do see one issue with this ruling though.
3849-Up to this point, I believe that telemarketers relied on the fact that cell phones and landlines were completely seperate.
3850-They knew which extensions mobile operators had and would not call those numbers (since it is illegal to telemarket to a cell phone since it costs the customer money).
3851-Now, that line is completely removed.
3852-Is there going to be a national database of cellular versus landlines?
3853-How secure would that be?
3854-Being constantly screwed over by your job but still being paid well and not wanting to ruin your resume by quitting before you put in two years has to be one of the most frustrating situations in the world.

3859-I believe that a car with at least a single, glaring issue should not be in contention for car of the year.

3878-This is for my own personal use; stay out.
3879-Animals, animals and more animals.
3880-Russell's older brother is currently studying to be a veterinarian.
3881-Before we moved in together, Russ mentioned that he might want to get a dog eventually.
3882-Back then, I stated that I wouldn't have any problem with that whatsoever as long as he was the one to take care of the dog.
3883-I wouldn't mind having to ocassionally fill a food dish or take the pup out for a walk, but that would be about it.
3884-The topic was dropped then, but Russ' brother recently had to spay/neuter a puppy for his studies.
3885-Usually, these dogs are mutts from the Humane Society, but this one turned out to be a purebred doberman pinscher.
3886-Since this dog was just so darned cute, Russ had to bring up the idea of getting a dog since his brother could give it away to anyone.
3887-I said the same thing as before but pointed out that this dog wasn't going to be small for very long.
3888-Also, he would probably destroy something if he was kept in the apartment by himself for 10+ hours a day.
3889-We agreed, no puppy for us.
3890-Kat and her parents have a total of three cats.
3891-Two of them, Charlotte and Emily (the "Bronte Sisters") have been with the family for quite a few years now.
3892-They are a mix between what seems to be to be a Russian Blue or Chartreux and an orange English Shorthair.
3893-The third cat is Sebastian, a brown tabby, and is only 6 months old.
3894-Emily is fairly social, so it wasn't much of a surprise when she felt comfortable enough to come up to me.
3895-The other two are a different story.
3896-Sebastian is still in the playful kitty phase, but Kat told me that I'm the only person other than herself that he has cuddled with.
3897-As for Charlotte, she isn't terribly social so Kat is also surprised when she always comes up to me for affection.
3898-I think Kat is just jealous!
3899-Kitties love me.

3903-Instead of holding the taco flat to your face to talk, which would seem normal, you hold the edge of the phone (AKA bottom of the taco) against your face to talk.

3917-I needed to dispose of a few plastic containers that I used to move in and our apartment complex only offers a chute for trash bags.
3918-These plastic totes barely fit into my hatchback, so they sure as heck were not going to fit down that chute.
3919-Thankfully, there is a large string of medical centers about a block from here because of the hospital being so close.
3920-Friday night at 5 PM, the day after a holiday, few people are going to be in the office.

3936-I really shouldn't think about the SVT too much because I want to kick myself for getting the ZX3 instead.
3937-The retail price on my ZX3 was MORE than a well-equipped SVT and the SVT is a better vehicle in almost all regards (other than noise and softness of ride).
3938-170 HP, almost as fast as a 911 Carrera in the slalom, okay gotta stop thinking about it.
3939-If only I was more comfortable with a manual, I would have bought it back in July...
3940-Anyway, back to the article.
3941-The ST model that is mentioned is probably similar to the UK-spec ST170:  basically the same engine as the SVT (170 HP) but without the rest of the upgrades (suspension, tires, brakes, interior, transmission, etc).
3942-Weekend update:  On Sunday, I finally made it to a donation center.
3943-When I first moved out to Washington, I brought all of my college apartment furniture, electronics and applicances.
3944-I figured that I would have enough startup costs with moving into a new apartment and buying a car that I could use my old college crap for awhile to get me by.
3945-I dropped quite a bit on the down payment for the car and had to buy a few essentials for the apartment (sofa, bed, desk, dresser, bookshelves, everything for the bathroom, etc) so I was glad I brought everything else.
3946-I've slowly replaced a few items and instead of getting rid of them immediately, I just tossed them into the corner of the room!
3947-Basically, we had an extra TV, VCR and TV stand in our living room for the past three months.
3948-Kat showed me the local Goodwill donation center Sunday morning so I packed up the ol' Focus hatchback and finally made a donation.
3949-I got rid of said TV, VCR and TV stand along with two huge garbage bags of clothes (cleaned and folded, thank you), microwave, toaster, coffee pot and some other assorted items.
3950-They didn't take the TV, so I just tossed it into the garbage/recycle room in my complex.
3951-If it's still there after trash day, I will probably take it to a real recycle center since Jeff informed me that the tube contains toxic materials.
3952-After getting rid of so much stuff, I decided I need to fill those now-empty spaces with new stuff.
3953-I picked up a duvet cover and blanket (both in dark blue) and then Jeff and I went out shopping.

4040-Basically, this article is full of facts and a gross misuse of these facts.
4041-They have correct information about the Galileo craft and some fairly factual discussion about fission, fusion and bombs.

4079-I knew that Kat was leaving for a business trip on Sunday morning and that she would be pretty busy getting ready on Saturday night, so I planned on seeing her.
4080-Around 7:30 PM, Mark called and said that he was going out to some bars downtown with Dan and some friends.
4081-I figured that Kat, Jeff, Russ and I hadn't been out drinking in awhile so I thought we could all get together.
4082-Well, all the stress of trying to close on a new townhome, stress of work and stress of trying to get ready for a week-long business trip caught up to Kat.
4083-She decided that I should just go out with the guys and have fun.
4084-No way!
4085-If this was probably the last night I would get to see her for a week, of course I was going to try to see her.
4086-I basically had to convince her to let me come over and that I would go out with the guys afterward.
4087-We had a fairly quiet night at her place and I tried my damnest to wash away some of her stress.
4088-By the time I got back to my apartment, Russ was sound asleep and Mark never called me to say where he would be downtown.
4089-That ended that night.
4090-Saturday was a bit more productive.
4091-I figured that I wouldn't be able to see Kat at all, so I was going to tackle some Christmas shopping.
4092-Before I got started with that, Jeff and I grabbed lunch at King and I, a Thai restaurant near his apartment.
4093-Not too bad, but their take on "3 star" spicy was definitely including White Man Penalty and was thus fairly mild.
4094-I then headed over to the local mall and spent a good three hours shopping.
4095-I was looking mostly for gifts for my parents but I seemed to find more gifts for myself.
4096-Not surprising.
4097-Kat called me soon after that saying that she was mostly ready for her trip and that we should hang out for a bit.
4098-We originally decided to grab coffee some place, but by the time we actually got around to leaving her place, it was dinner time.
4099-She felt like Mexican, so we started off toward Fremont since she knew of a fairly authentic restaurant out that way.
4100-Traffic over the bridge to Seattle was horrendous, so we turned back to Bellevue.
4101-We hit  urlLink Spazzo , which recently changed from Mediterranean to Italian.
4102-and had a fairly nice meal.
4103-The wine was better than the entrees and the goat cheese appetizer was served with bread that was impossibly hard and terribly over-soaked in olive oil.
4104-All in all, a nice evening, as most are with her!
4105-Today was completely lazy...
4106-I didn't do anything productive until 3 PM, unless you count making eggs for breakfast and playing an hour of Grand Theft Auto III as productive.
4107-Russ and I visited  urlLink Caffe Ladro  so I could read more of The Brothers Karamazov and he could study for accounting.
4108-It was good going out with him since we spend so much time in the apartment.
4109-"As I get older, you know, I won't be a pretty object.
4110-The wenches won't come to me of their own accord, so I will need my money.
4111-So I am saving up more and more, simply for myself, my dear son.
4112-You may as well know.
4113-For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you.
4114-For sin is sweet.
4115-All abuse it but all men live in it.
4116-The only difference is that others do it on the sly and I do it openly.
4117-And so all the other sinners fall upon me for being so simple.
4118-And your paradise, Alyosha, is not to my taste, let me tell you that.
4119-It's not the proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists.
4120-I believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all.
4121-You can pray for my soul if you like.
4122-And if you don't want to, don't, damn you!
4123-That's my philosophy."

4126-Nokia paid alot of money for this privilege, and they deserve the courtesy.
4127-assholes."
4128-Since Nokia is my current corporate enemy, I just had to laugh.
4129-Remind me to quote Pg.
4130-172, last paragraph  of The Brothers Karamazov later.
4131-Remind me to post later about my weekend, how Kat is gone for a week and about holiday parties.
4132-Oh, and  urlLink White Ribbon Week  as well.
4133-Just yesterday, I was reading a  urlLink discussion on Fark  about  labels and the common consensus was that people did not want to pay to advertise for a company.
4134-Someone joked that you don't see Armani suits with "ARMANI" written across the front in huge letters.
4135-Someone followed that up with a desire to see an Armani trucker hat.
4136-Well, I went shopping later that day and what did I see:  urlLink    An Armani Exchange trucker hat!
4137-Perfect timing.
4138-I'm starting to enjoy the fact that my phone has a camera now.

4140-Even more photos of the new Lancer WRC04.
4141-Nope, still don't like it.
4142-"Grushenka was twenty-two years old and her face looked exactly that age.
4143-She had very white skin with a pale pink tint on her cheeks.
4144-The modeling of her face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward.
4145-Her upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full and looked pouting.
4146-But her magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her sable-colored eyebrows and charming grey-blue eyes with their long lashes woukd have made the most indifferent person, meeting her casually in a crowd in the street, stop at the sight of her face and remember it long after."

           So,  urlLink Walmart  has decided to open their own  urlLink online music service .
4148-My first thought was, Walmart with an online service, up against a formidable opponent like iTunes Music Store?
4149-Then again, people thought the same thing about Microsoft coming out with the XBox to go against Sony and the PS2.
4150-Anyway, this serivce, much like the new Napster, uses WMA 9.
4151-Because of this, no one with a Mac can use this service and this is even mentioned in their  urlLink FAQ .
4152-Oddly enough,  urlLink this page  has a screen shot from a Mac!
4153-Observed first by a  urlLink Slashdot member .
4154-Sorry that I disappeared for a few days there; I have a good reason.
4155-On Monday while playing racquetball, I severely injured my knee again.
4156-Here is how I did it.
4157-Instead of wearing my normal cross-trainer shoes to play rball, I was wearing my turf shoes.
4158-Turf shoes have amazing traction on almost any surface, including the hardwood floor of the rball court.
4159-Whenever I land from a jump, I keep my foot perpendicular to my shoulders until I land, when I rotate my foot away from my body for added balance.
4160-that is how you are supposed to land.
4161-Well, when I landed this time, I went to rotate my foot but my shoe decided to have super traction and not move.
4162-All of the rotational force went straight to the inner portion of my left knee.
4163-It was 10 PM by the time I got home, so I couldn't see a doctor on Monday.
4164-The next morning, I waited until I heard from Kat to make an appointment since I figured her dad (a doctor) would be able to make a good recommendation.
4165-When I called to make an appointment at 11 AM, they were booked for the day and I had to wait until Wednesday.
4166-The x-ray shows that I definitely did some serious damage and that I also have a bone shard taken off the medial portion of my left knee.
4167-Because of the amount of swelling, the doc recommended that I get an MRI.
4168-That was done the same day but I will not get the results until at least Friday afternoon.
4169-The current prognosis is a torn MCL, stretched ACL, torn meniscus and the bone shard.
1127-Lovely.
4171-I'm currently wearing a huge brace but the pain is not so bad.
4172-It comes and goes and luckily I can walk fairly well.
4173-I missed a day and a half of work, so I'm a bit behind now.
4174-urlLink ZAGAT SURVEY: Unfit for print          
           Whoa, Saddam captured?
4175-I guess being up at 5 AM has the advantage of knowing the breaking news.
4176-4:15 AM and I've been trying to sleep since 11:30 PM.
4177-The only explanation is that the decaf coffee I ordered during dessert wasn't quite decaf.
4178-Merry Christmas!
4179-I will increase my post frequency soon once my parents go back to Michigan.
4180-Why is it that I had never heard of the terms "bollywood" or "steam punk", yet I've seen both a handful of times just this week?
4181-Disclaimer:  For no real reason, I have always disliked Walmart.
4182-Maybe it was because, for the longest time, there were no Walmarts nearby either my hometown of Livonia, MI or my college town of Ann Arbor, MI.
4183-That has since changed, with stores in or near both cities.
4184-Maybe it was because Walmart always had a southern, poor slant to it.
4185-Maybe it was because we had a similar store, Meijer's, in our area and I was pledging a local allegiance.
4186-For whatever reason, I never liked Walmart.
4187-I've always heard that Walmart was an "evil" company.
4188-From details like hiring illegal aliens for stock and cleaning work to treating "regular" employees poorly to pushing around suppliers, the comments swirled around and painted a dirty portrait.
4189-When I was back working at the Daily with Scott as my manager, he spoke of Walmart as being worse than an other company he knew of.
4190-He had facts from reputible sources, and though being an activist, used them properly.
4191-Now having read this  urlLink article  from fastcompany.com, I'm starting to see the details about how Walmart interacts with suppliers.
4192-From first glance, it does seem evil, overbearing and monopolistic.
4193-At the same time, isn't that what capitalism is all about?
4194-A mostly-free market for companies to do as they please?
4195-Walmart doesn't force smaller suppliers to cut costs, Walmart is just such a large and successful company that the small suppliers need to be up to Walmart standards.
4196-I won't go so far as to condone their practices and I do agree that Walmart needs to improve their human rights issues, but don't fault a company for being successful.
4197-Let's see, what's been going on lately...  Chris and Lindsay are getting married this fall.
4198-Definitely congratulations to them!
4199-I am the best man, so that means I should get started on writing the toast.
4200-I've been best friends with Chris since 1992 and I've known Lindsay for years, so I will have lots of material with which to work.
4201-My knee is slowly healing.
4202-No longer do I need to wear my brace daily, just when exercising.
4203-I no longer limp around and I have full range of motion.
4204-I am supposed to go snowboarding this weekend, but that is not going to happen.
4205-If I really want to heal on time, I need to do more physical therapy.
4206-There is some political crap going on at work, but I can't say much yet.
4207-I still have a job, so I am okay.
4208-So Kat spent the night last night because she had a big day today and her parents wouldn't leave her alone long enough to do her work.
4209-She comes over here, and I set not one but two alarms so that she wouldn't be late for the big day.
4210-Well, I set my bedside alarm clock for 6:30 PM instead of 6:30 AM and my PDA/phone didn't fire the alarm because the phone portion was off.
4211-I'm really sorry.
4212-Altruism, as a concept, exists.
4213-Altruism, as reality, does not exist.
4214-My parents were here for a week during the holidays.
4215-There aren't too many highlights, since we decided to keep the vacation relaxing.
4216-We didn't want it to be one of those vacations where you have to keep to a schedule and cram in as much as possible.
4217-They didn't even go to the Space Needle!
4218-Some of the places we did end up going were Snoqualmie Falls, Pike Place (NOT a good place for someone in a wheelchair) and a casino in Tulalip.
4219-Other highlights include me making five batches of scones, cooking Christmas dinner and then Kat meeting my parents on the last night they were here.
4220-I believe it was beneficial to have them out here, for both parties.
4221-For thier sake, they got to see how I am living my life and meet some of the new people in my life.
4222-For my sake, I got to see them for a little while in the comfort of my own home without having to break much from my normal routine.
4223-Dialing the time machine back to about a month ago...
4224-So, the holiday parties last month.
4225-All three parties were right in a row this year:  Thursday was the organization-wide party at EMP, Friday was the team-wide party at a lodge at Snoqualmie Pass and Saturday was Kat's party at some little restaurant in Puyallup.
4226-Thursday started off very slowly.
4227-I was supposed to meet some of the younger members of my team at EMP around 7:30 PM and eventhough I got there at 7:45 PM, I was still early.
4228-Eventually, everyone showed up and the party picked up.
4229-The food was good, but the two drink tickets didn't last very long.
4230-Being the ingenious people that we are, us Microsoft people, we figured out that we could simply exit the building, come back in, show our ID and get two more tickets.
4231-Of course I didn't do this, but my ID was used by a non-Microsoftie for this purpose.
4232-Afterward, a few of us were supposed to go out to a bar, but we all parted ways for a bit and we were supposed to reconvene 15 minutes later.
4233-15 minutes later, one of the girls still hadn't showed up.
4234-We were all a bit drunk and antsy to get away from the formal party, so we just left.
4235-Four of us went over to a friends place and continued the drinking and watched some TV.
4236-I ended up fitting five people in my car, dropped them all off, and called it a night.
4237-The next day, the team party was supposed to start at 10 AM, but since I knew there was no rush, I didn't end up getting there until 12:30 PM.
4238-The drive up to Snoqualmie Pass was interesting at least for the fact that it was the first snow I had ever seen in Washington.
4239-The farther up the mountain, the more snow there was (shocking, I know).
4240-By the time I hit the exit for the Pass, traffic was down to 30 MPH.
4241-I actually passed someone on my team on the exit, which wasn't surprising since he had a RWD Bimmer with bald tires.
4242-Anyway, most of the day was pretty laid back.
4243-A few of the highlights included me running the white elephant gift exchange (including a box of old Atari games, a Nascar coffee table book and a bike axle), playing DDR, and a snowball fight that included someone in a hot tub.
4244-I picked up Kat from the airport that night, but I can't remember the rest of the evening.
4245-The final day of holiday parties was at some crappy little restaurant in a crappy little town far far south of Seattle.
4246-This was with Kat's coworkers, who had an average age of just about 35.
4247-It was slightly odd socializing with them, but luckily we got a table with the friendliest of the bunch.
4248-The food was horrible, the drinks were crap, and the supposed white elephant gift exchange wasn't!
4249-Kat brought a gag gift, since that's the point of a white elephant gift exchange, yet some of the other gifts included a fondue set, a set of nice martini glasses and a clock from Pottery Barn.
4250-For dessert, I ordered decaf coffee.
4251-Since I was awake until 5 AM and got about two hours of sleep all night, I believe it wasn't decaf.
4252-Anyway, the parties overall were typical work holiday parties.
4253-Making NASA stronger == Kill NASA.
4254-Don't Leave Children Behind == Leave them behind.
4255-Healthy Forests == Cut down the forests.
4256-Clear Skies Act == Degraded air quality standards.
4257-Improve Head Start == Dismantle Head Start.
4258-Taken from Slashdot  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .
4259-urlLink Slashdot :  Woo, Services for Unix is now free!
4260-The most important part is that it is almost completely based on OpenBSD.
4261-Running OBSD tools on Windows sounds like a great fusion to me.
4262-So, I've heard of mice with too many additional buttons to be useful, but thankfully my new mouse just has left click, right click, scroll wheel, scroll up button, scroll down button, task switch and then two currently unassigned buttons that I would assume are used for forward and backward in a web browser.
4263-That may sound like a lot of buttons, but I think of the scroll up and down buttons as just an extension of the wheel and the task switch button is miniscule.
4264-Now the keyboard on the other hand is just asinine.
4265-Along with the normal keys that a normal keyboard has (letters, numbers, punctuation, navigation and keypad), this one has seperate keys for scrolling, go, back, sleep, f-lock, e-mail, messenger/sms, webcam, media, mute, volume up/down, last track, next track, stop, play, iTouch, search, shopping, favorites, and my home.
4266-Additionally to that, it has a function key to enable new, reply, forward, send, undo, redo, print, save, my computer, my documents, my pictures, and my music.
4267-To make matters worse, they labeled the normal control key functions like undo, cut, copy and paste.
4268-They keyboard is just a little bit overboard!
4269-Living in the land of coffee, I have yet to be impressed by the coffee shops available out here.
4270-There is no end to the number of Starbucks available and there is a healthy dose of Tully's as well.
4271-The only place I've enjoyed so far has been Caffe Ladro, and they are only located in Seattle proper.
4272-Well, today I found out about a place in Redmond called Victor's, located at 7993 Gilman St.
4273-I will have to give it a try soon!
4274-So I go to backup my MP3 drive on my server and it crashes, deleting every single MP3 I have collected for the past six years!
4275-I am going to cry.
4276-There was so much effort put into building that collection, from ripping my own CDs to downloading full albums from Kazaa to emusic (which isn't even the same site anymore).
4277-So pissed.
4278-Happy four month anniversary!
4279-Last night, I originally planned on leaving work a bit early, taking a nap, having a quick bite to eat and then hitting the gym with Jeff.
4280-None of that happened!
4281-Around 5:30 PM, Eric and I were talking about the new laptop he just ordered.
4282-I told him not to buy Office from Dell since I could get a good deal on a legit copy of Office 2003 from work.
4283-I decided to run to the company store right then since I was tired and needed a bit of fresh air.
4284-After that, Lee sent me a chat request and convinced me to join him and some of his MS friends for dinner.
4285-We went to Cucina Cucina (a decent to mediocre italian restaurant, thankfully we get 2-for-1 specials) and had a fun time.
4286-It was good to meet new people, but I sometimes forget how horribly dorky we can all be.
4287-I explained how Microsofties and non-Microsofties have difficulty mingling and there needs to be a certain percentage (we estimated 60%) of non-Microsofties for a group to work.
4288-I still planned on going to the gym with Jeff, but he was feeling fairly comfortable at home and wanted to skip it.
4289-Good thing, since Russ called me soon after wanting to get drinks to unwind from a 13 hour day.
4290-We went to  urlLink Tap House , he got dinner and I got a liquid dinner of an Emerald City Tea and a Manhattan.
4291-I pretty much ordered the tea (vodka, gin, rum, midori, pineapple, sprite) because it already looked like Russ and I were on a date, so I had to get something fruity and served in a hurricane glass.
4292-The Manhattan was used to bring up my testosterone levels afterward.
4293-We had a good discussion and I'm glad I skipped working out.
4294-I can always go a bit harder tonight.
4295-Kat and I had quite a relaxing and enjoyable weekend, if I may say so myself.
4296-Originally, we had planned to go to  urlLink Dahlia Lounge  for dinner on Friday, but we both had a hard week and figured we wouldn't be up for such a nice dinner.
4297-Instead, we ended up going to  urlLink Wasabi Bistro  and had some of the best sushi available in Western Washington.
4298-We tried two of their signature rolls, the Spicy 101 and the Belltown.
4299-Other than an overabundance of mayo on the Spicy 101, the meal was great.
4300-Kat had a craving for edamame and that was satisfied by the complementary bowl served with every dinner.
4301-Much of Saturday morning was spent lounging around my apartment, but it was definitely not a waste of time.
4302-Much of the afternoon was spent at Starbucks:  Kat doing work, me just playing around on the internet.
4303-That evening, we made the  urlLink first meal in her new townhome .
4304-We made spinach and cheese ravioli, fresh bread and a mixed greens salad.
4305-All in all, very enjoyable.
4306-Before we could make dinner, however, I had to put together the table and chairs we would need to eat off!
4307-I've gotten pretty good at putting together Ikea furniture, so it didn't take too long.
4308-Sunday saw me fighting with my server for a good part of the afternoon and then having dinner at Kat's parents.
4309-We played a dominos game called Mexican Train and then had a lovely filet dinner.
4310-Her dad and I did most of the talking, but I think everyone enjoyed themselves.
4311-I have now moved to my fourth office in six months.
4312-If anyone takes my stapler, this place is going down!
4313-I have been a bit behind in adding new image galleries to the navigation.
4314-I have since added these galleries:   Events   urlLink Snow 01.06.2004   urlLink Chicago 01.01.2004   urlLink New Years Eve 12.31.2003   urlLink Holiday Party 12.13.2003   urlLink Holiday Party 12.12.2003   urlLink Go-Karting 10.18.2003   Stuff   urlLink Cats 01.03.2004   urlLink Verona 10.28.2003            
           Mmmm, new  urlLink wireless keyboard and mouse ...
4315-Thanks,  urlLink slickdeals !
4316-It's Fifteen Minute Photoshop time!
4317-Basically, my bedroom is not in the most optimal configuration.
4318-Both of my tall bookshelves are covering up one window completely and part of another window.
4319-So, I started thinking about alternative arrangements.
4320-Knowning me, I couldn't just visualize this or write it out on a sheet paper, I decided to measure and model my room in Photoshop.
4321-It's pretty hard to see on the left, but there is a long window there.
4322-The upper left red line is another window.
4323-The red line on the right is the bathroom door.
4324-Here is my suggested layout:     This clears both windows (since the dresser fits underneath the window and the sides of the bed are not against the bed) and seems like a good idea.
4325-Bah, no time to do it tonight.
4326-I've been wrestling with hardware issues for about four days now.
4327-That is what I get for naming a server fireball!
4328-Basically, the machine that has been my internet router, NAT box, development web server, database server, RDP proxy has gone through quite a few upgrades.
4329-It originally was my old overclocking desktop (thus, "fireball") running a 300 MHz Celeron.
4330-It was upgraded to a 500 MHz PIII and it currently has a 700 MHz Duron.
4331-A month or so ago, I bought a new 120 GB drive for my desktop (thanks,  urlLink Slickdeals !)
4332-and last week I finally got around to putting my old 30 GB drive into fireball.
4333-The problems started then.
4334-Since the 30 GB drive was already in my desktop, I decided to install OpenBSD 3.4 on the drive before transferring it to the server.
4335-That install went smoothly, but the drive would not boot when I transferred it.
4336-I figured it just didn't like the transfer, so I reinstalled OpenBSD while in fireball.
4337-When I tried to boot after the second install, the bootloader would come up with crap like "@$%@#$*@#$#$%!@#((^%".
4338-After 45 minutes of playing around with the bootloader, the BIOS and the boot sequence, I finally figured out that it wouldn't boot unless the drive was the primary on the IDE chain.
4339-Ok, finally got the new drive up and running!
4340-When installing OBSD, my first steps are to install the ports tree, tcsh, vim, the source and add 'mbibik' as a user.
4341-I got as far as compiling tcsh static when the machine just froze, hard.
4342-I figured, whatever, just a random lockup.
4343-Nope, anytime I taxed the processor, the machine would freeze.
4344-Obviously (at least to me), this seemed like a heat issue.
4345-I opened the case to check out the CPU fan, but it's a fairly small (AKA cramped) case so I couldn't see the fan behind the power supply.
4346-I monitored the CPU temp and it never seemed to get into dangerous territory.
4347-I gave up at this point and told Russell the internet would be down for awhile (no server, no NAT, no internet).
4348-I started to play with it again, but there isn't much you can do when the damned thing freezes every 15 minutes!
4349-I gave up trying to install tcsh, vim, etc and just started surfing the net from my desktop.
4350-Oddly enough, it didn't lock up.
4351-At this point, I realized that interactive activities such as installing or compiling are probably accessing the disk more than just using the box as a router (which would only access the disk to periodically write logs).
4352-I switched back to the old drive, and all is well.
4353-Too bad my 30 GB drive is fried!
4354-Reminder for later:  Sour Times;  Breath From Another         
           "Everywhere in these days men have ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather that in isolated individual effort."
4355-- F. Dostoyevsky         
           Looks like Jeff, his office mate, some other coworkers and I are going to hit a shooting range next week.
4356-In honor of this great event, here are some  urlLink video clips  of things being shot.
4357-My favorite is the wide angle view of the pudding cup spreading it's life force across the screen.
4358-Ok, so I updated the moblogging gallery without posting.
4359-Bad Mike.
4360-Here is a rundown of the updates:   Katherine in her natural habitat, Starbucks.
4361-urlLink     A store called "Lovers Package" in Redmond.
1127-Lovely.
4363-urlLink     Jamie, killing time at the airport since NWA forgot to fly out my luggage.
4364-urlLink     The Jimmy John's menu.
4365-A work of art.
4366-urlLink     The Jimmy John's menu and Alissa.
4367-Dual works of art.
4368-urlLink     Megan looking as holy as ever.
4369-urlLink     My second favorite mexican wrestler.
4370-urlLink     Emily Lahtinen, an old girlfriend that I ran into on a recent trip back to Detroit.
4371-urlLink     I wonder what movie they are going to see?
4372-urlLink     Crappy suit?
4373-Check.
4374-Old-model Porsche?
4373-Check.
4376-Talking on a cell phone at all times?
4373-Check.
4378-Sleazy lawyer?
2733-Of course.
4380-urlLink     Joe at Amer's.
4381-urlLink     Leah at Amer's.
4382-urlLink     Yes, that shirt says "If it has tits or tires, it's gonna' give you trouble!"
4383-Yes, I saw that in public at the airport.
4384-urlLink               
           I should have posted this as soon as I woke up this morning, but I can never seem to get going until 1.5 hours after I wake up.
4385-Unless I wake up late, I will kill 1.5 hours every morning.
4386-Granted, I consider my drive to work to be killed time simply because I am nowhere near fully awake and thus I drive by instinct.
4387-Listening to commercials the entire way there is not uncommon, simply because I am not paying attention whatsoever.
4388-Anyway, the post.
4389-The remembered dream from last night consisted of some sort of party.
4390-It was possibly a party for me, or just a party in general.
4391-I believe it was a party for me since I was given a car (an Audi TT, or at least the shell of one.
4392-Someone said the rest would be in next week.
4393-Odd choice of car since I do not and have never wanted a TT.)
4394-and there was an interesting gag gift.
4395-Basically, someone took all of my prized possesions, which curiously included a house, shrunk them down and locked them in a glass case for everyone to look at.
4396-All throughout the party I never noticed this case.
4397-Once everyone had left, it finally revealed itself and of course I tried to pry it open to retreive my things!
4398-It was a long case, probably 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and high.
4399-The case was in segments, each with a sealed door.
4400-After attempting to pry each door open, the last segment contained what looked like just a piece of yellow paper.
4401-This door opened, and out flew a few miniature (fruit fly-sized) bees!
4402-I'm not allergic nor phobic of bees, but I am not a fan.
4403-For some reason, my mind told me that an ex-girlfriend, Emily, had done all of this.
4404-Made no sense!
4405-urlLink CNN.com - Study: That Neanderthal was not your grandfather - Jan. 26, 2004          
           When visiting Cannon Beach for Valentines Day, here are some possibly decent restaurants:  urlLink The Nehalem River Inn Restaurant   urlLink Blue Sky Cafe   urlLink The Riverhouse          
           God, come in god, god, come in god.
4406-Damn you're a girl.
4407-Well, I guess the reason why I'm talking to you tonight is because I've been doing a lot of thinking.
4408-I consider mysef a pretty cool guy and I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends.
4409-Well, except that one lil' time in Japan, but that was just head and head don't count, right?
4410-Aww, thanks god, I knew you'd understand.
4411-Well, I just feel like, well to be honest with you, god, I just need a sweet bitch.
4412-Ya know, somebody not too fast, but not too slow, 'cause I dont have it all my damn self and life ain't easy.
4413-Ya know you just want someone by your side to help smooth that thang out.
4414-At this point, I'm not being picky, she doesn't have to have a big ol' ass, ya know.
4415-Just something well proportioned to her body, ya know a nice lil' tail.
4416-What, you say, you say you found somebody?
4417-Is she cute?
4418-So when do I get to meet her?
4419-Aww, god, you're the greatest.
4420-Well, I guess I'll talk to you later.
4421-Amen.
4422-oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a-lady.
4423-- "God" by Outkast.
4424-No, Kat, this has nothing to do with you, this is just the worlds greatest interlude.
4425-Tis the time to start questioning my health.
4426-Let's just say that for a past few months I've been having some odd issues for someone my age.
4427-Just today, I had a serious headache kick in around 2:00 PM.
4428-At first, it seemed to be another caffeine-based headache, but my caffeine intake has been quite minimal lately.
4429-Instead of trying to fight it, I just called it a day and went home to rest.
4430-Though I didn't feel tired until the headache kicked in and I've been getting adequate sleep, I ended up taking a 2.5 hour nap.
4431-I'm still feeling a bit groggy.
4432-Let's just chalk all of these problems to stress and not enough exercise (at least lately) and hope they all go away.
4433-Ignore it; it will go away.
4434-Procrastinating between posts requires a Herculean effort to catch up.
1657-Sigh.
4436-Well, last weekend I went back to Detroit for the second time in three weeks.
4437-The main reason for going back was to attend the  urlLink auto show  and to see friends and family.
4438-I arrived around 6 AM, rented a car, drove back to Livonia and just fell down dead in my bed.
4439-Once noon rolled around, my aunt and I went to the Plymouth Ice Show ( urlLink image gallery ) and just hung out for a bit.
4440-The ice sculptures cannot really be considered art, though some of the pieces showed some technical skill and creativity.
4441-Also, art doesn't usually melt after two weeks...
4442-It was cold enough for my body to shut down blood flow to my hands, so much so that I had difficulty using keys to get back into the car to get warm.
4443-The rest of the evening was spent with Chris.
4444-We hit Twelve Oaks to grab some  urlLink Panera  (they really need to open one here in Washington:  fresh and chewy breads, sharp cheeses and choice cuts of meat make a great sandwich) and then sat around his place until the Chris and Lindsay engagement party ( urlLink image gallery ) started.
4445-It was a laid back affair consisting of wine and beer and conversation.
4446-This was the first party I've been to with Megan, Iren and Lindsday where they didn't go on a 1.5 hour tangent about their childhood, a discussion which no one else can participate in.
4447-No offense girls, just don't do that again!
4448-I talked to Marty for a bit and his opening bit was classic Marty:  Ma: "Have you ever watched Twin Peaks?"
4449-Mi: "Not really, a few episodes, but I know you are a big fan."
4450-Ma: "So why did you go to Snoqualmie then?"
4451-My first reaction was that this was just Marty being Marty (if you know him, you know what I mean.
4452-Otherwise, you aren't going to meet him, so don't worry about it), and then I realized that Twin Peaks was filmed in Washington, near a waterfall and then it clicked.
4453-I didn't feel like defending my choice to visit Snoqualmie for a non-Twin Peaks reason and Marty was just trying to show that he has been following my site.
4454-Casey, one of the Northvillians that Chris used to hang out with every week back in high school, was also at the party.
4455-By the eighth beer, he was becoming quite the extrovert.
4456-He knew what he was doing, so he was enjoying the party laughing at him whilst he laughed inside.
4457-The next morning was the auto show ( urlLink image gallery ) with my dad and grandpa.
4458-Honestly and unfortunately, I wasn't terribly impressed with the show this year.
4459-That shouldn't be much of a surprise since this is the first year where I've been in the actual market for a car.
4460-Previously, I was most excited about the exotic concept cars but now I want to see vechicles that are in showrooms that I can and want to purchase.
4461-Since I just recently purchased a car, I was looking toward the future, toward what should be my next car.
4462-Based on the fact that the Focus is a three-year purchase, that will put my next round at the summer of 2006.
4463-Considering that I should be able to afford a much nicer car, I was looking at the BMW M3 and the Audi S4 as possibilities.
4464-I took many pictures of each, and got a good feel inside and out for the look of the cars.
4465-The M3 has a terribly dated interior and it will be redesigned within the next 18 months.
4466-The redesign could take the car in any direction, basically invalidating any observation of the current model.
4467-The S4 has a delicious interior and the exterior styling is sedate enough yet still sporty.
4468-While this car is a sedan, the back seat leg room is laughable at best.
4469-With the drivers seat fully back, I could barely fit in the S4.
4470-In contrast, I had plenty of leg room in the Infiniti G35 coupe, though head room was an issue there.
4471-Hopefully by the time I am completely fed up with the Focus, a new car will hit my target requirements: 0-60 MPH  Mature styling, inside and out (no more thoughts of the STi or Evo) High  urlLink build quality  (Odd, I didn't realize that Audi was so far down the list...) Ample room for 4 More to come I wholeheartedly recommend the Infiniti site for  urlLink car comparison .
4472-Their tool pulls in just about every specification you need for comparing cars.
4473-Ok, enough for one post.
4474-"It's like trying to rebuild a car that has been disassembled to individual parts with just a crayon drawing as a template."
4475-- Me, trying to explain a situation at work.
4476-God damnit, Winamp!
4477-You were great back in the v2 days!
4478-Then you turn into v3, a bloated, slow, mockery of a rewrite.
4479-Oh lo', you said that v5 would be the best of v2 and the best of v3 combined!
4480-All I get is crash after crash after crash.
4481-DELETED!
4482-iTunes for me for life, or until something better comes along.
4483-UPDATE:  So I go to uninstall Winamp and the uninstall program freezes my system!
4484-I force-reboot (no, not a Jedi power) and try again.
4485-It takes four minutes for the uninstall UI to come up.
4486-Once the app uninstalled, it crashed explorer (not IE), requiring another reboot.
4487-Bah!
4488-More moblogging:  What Katherine thought was chocolate cake at about 5 feet away.
4489-urlLink     The Super Bowl was so boring that Sharry started playing solitare.
4490-urlLink     That TL wasn't rice, this Civic is rice.
4491-urlLink     See?
4492-I'm not the only person in Redmond/Bellevue that drives a Focus ZX3.
4493-urlLink     A Beetle with Altezzas.
1657-Sigh.

4496-So, would you get just the TL:   ...or would you get the TL with a side of rice?
4497-urlLink Ford GT 1 minute ad .
4498-I could seriously watch the burn out at the beginning of this commercial over and over.
4499-The entire vehicle is a work of art.
4500-This isn't going to help Ford one lick, but it's still an amazing vehicle.
4501-"Too bad I don't have my rich grandfather anymore."
4502-- 10 year-old girl heard outside Big Apple Bagels in Bellevue, WA.
4503-urlLink GROW :  11,500 so far.
4504-I'm going to figure this out, damnit.
4505-UPDATE:  Ok, 13,900.
4506-I'm close!
4507-I've spent so much time on this site now that I cannot remember where I came from to get to it (No, I can't just hit back in my browser since I open almost all new links as a tab in  urlLink Mozilla ), but it was probably  urlLink Slashdot .
4508-Anyway, after having debated for a few years in high school, I learned a few terms for debate tactics, but here is an  urlLink entire site  with terms for each fallacy.
4509-Honestly, I must have observed all of these at one time or another.
4510-A few are extremely frustrating because it is almost as hard to explain the fallacy as it is to fight in the debate.
4511-Some examples are  urlLink burden of proof ,  urlLink confusing cause and effect  (seems easy to explain, just try with some people!
4512-), and  urlLink straw man .
4513-I will admit that I have used a handful of these fallacies as well, but I usually know I am using them.
4514-They are only used when I do not have quite enough evidence to back up my clain so I attempt to hoodwink someone with a fallacy while I think of better evidence.
4515-If someone catches me in the fallacy, now I can give an offical term for the fallacy to show that I genuinely knew what I was doing.
4516-I put almost $700 worth of food on my credit cards in December.
4517-Can you believe that?
4518-I spent about as much on food as I did on rent!
4519-Someone needs to stop eating out so much.

            urlLink Starbucks Drinks Simplified (kinda) :   A fairly comprensive list of all the drinks and options available at Starbucks.
4521-Just reading it made me thirsty so I had to grab a Venti nonfat, no foam vanilla latte.
4522-Gotta love the fact that most Microsoft cafeterias offer a full Starbucks as well.
4523-urlLink AOL Presidential Match Guide :   Yes, it's an AOL affiliate, but it's a fairly simple site to see which presidential candidate your beliefs most match.
4524-Here is my not terribly surprising list:  (100%) Kerry (96%)  Dean (93%)  Sharpton (93%)  Clark (91%)  Kucinich (87%)  Edwards (28%)  Bush         
            urlLink Reuters | Latest Financial News / Full News Coverage :   Nothing quite like an ageing rock band using a group of teenagers as stand ins, then seeing their first song in 20 years hit the charts.
4525-Excellent comment on society and a good social experiment.
4526-I believe George Carlin said it best:  Here is my problem with the ten commandments- why exactly are there 10?
4527-You simply do not need ten.
4528-The list of ten commandments was artificially and deliberately inflated to get it up to ten.
4529-Here's what happened:  About 5,000 years ago a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to try to figure out how to control people and keep them in line.
4530-They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so they announced that God had given them some commandments, up on a mountain, when no one was around.
4531-Well let me ask you this- when they were making this shit up, why did they pick 10?
4532-Why not 9 or 11?
4533-I'll tell you why- because 10 sound official.
4534-Ten sounds important!
4535-Ten is the basis for the decimal system, it's a decade, it's a psychologically satisfying number (the top ten, the ten most wanted, the ten best dressed).
4536-So having ten commandments was really a marketing decision!
4537-It is clearly a bullshit list.
4538-It's a political document artificially inflated to sell better.
4539-I will now show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that's a little more workable and logical.
4540-I am going to use the Roman Catholic version because those were the ones I was taught as a little boy.
4541-Let's start with the first three:  I AM THE LORD THY GOD THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE GODS BEFORE ME  THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN  THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH  Right off the bat the first three are pure bullshit.
4542-Sabbath day?
4543-Lord's name?
4544-strange gods?
4545-Spooky language!
4546-Designed to scare and control primitive people.
4547-In no way does superstitious nonsense like this apply to the lives of intelligent civilized humans in the 21st century.
4548-So now we're down to 7.
4549-Next:  HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER  Obedience, respect for authority.
4550-Just another name for controlling people.
4551-The truth is that obedience and respect shouldn't be automatic.
4552-They should be earned and based on the parent's performance.
4553-Some parents deserve respect, but most of them don't, period.
4554-You're down to six.
4555-Now in the interest of logic, something religion is very uncomfortable with, we're going to jump around the list a little bit.
4556-THOU SHALT NOT STEAL  THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS  Stealing and lying.
4557-Well actually, these two both prohibit the same kind of behavior- dishonesty.
4558-So you don't really need two you combine them and call the commandment "thou shalt not be dishonest".
4559-And suddenly you're down to 5.
4560-And as long as we're combining I have two others that belong together:  THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTRY  THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE  Once again, these two prohibit the same type of behavior.
4561-In this case it is marital infidelity.
4562-The difference is- coveting takes place in the mind.
4563-But I don't think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else's wife because what is a guy gonna think about when he's waxing his carrot?
4564-But, marital infidelity is a good idea so we're gonna keep this one and call it "thou shalt not be unfaithful".
4565-And suddenly we're down to four.
4566-But when you think about it, honesty and infidelity are really part of the same overall value so, in truth, you could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments and give them simpler language, positive language instead of negative language and call the whole thing "thou shalt always be honest and faithful" and we're down to 3.
4567-THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR"S GOODS  This one is just plain fuckin' stupid.
4568-Coveting your neighbor's goods is what keeps the economy going!
4569-Your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays "o come o ye faithful", and you want one too!
4570-Coveting creates jobs, so leave it alone.
4571-You throw out coveting and you're down to 2 now- the big honesty and fidelity commandment and the one we haven't talked about yet:  THOU SHALT NOT KILL  Murder.
4572-But when you think about it, religion has never really had a big problem with murder.
4573-More people have been killed in the name of god than for any other reason.
4574-All you have to do is look at Northern Ireland, Cashmire, the Inquisition, the Crusades, and the World Trade Center to see how seriously the religious folks take thou shalt not kill.
4575-The more devout they are, the more they see murder as being negotiable.
4576-It depends on who's doin the killin' and who's gettin' killed.
4577-So, with all of this in mind, I give you my revised list of the two commandments:  Thou shalt always be honest and faithful to the provider of thy nookie.
4578-and  Thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless of course they pray to a different invisible man than you.
4579-Two is all you need; Moses could have carried them down the hill in his fuckin' pocket.
4580-I wouldn't mind those folks in Alabama posting them on the courthouse wall, as long as they provided one additional commandment:  Thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.

4585-Hot Snakes, on the radio.
4586-Mmmm, if it wasn't for the fact that they play such a random playlist, I would love this station.
4587-It's just too random, meaning there are a few songs I love mixed in with a bunch of stuff I've never heard.
4588-I rarely like a song on one listen, so I rarely find anything new to like.
4589-urlLink AutoWeek - Car News :   Woohoo, even more Evo goodness!
4590-This new model has just a few changes, but they are all improvements and the base price isn't dramatically increased ($32k for the highest-priced model).

4592-I'm sick of silver and its variants.
4593-It seems that spammers are using a random dictionary attempt at creating "from" names.

4596-urlLink Wired 12.03: The Complete Guide to Googlemania!
4597-:   My first thought, 13 pages all about Google!
4598-This is great, mostly because Google is an interesting company to follow from a technological, political, economic and social aspect.
4599-Second thought, crap, 13 pages I have to slog through with a bunch of drivel added since this is Wired.
4600-Well, I read the whole thing, and it's at least worth a good skim.
4601-I didn't learn much, but that's okay.
4602-I haven't posted an actual update in far too long.
4603-Let's dial back the Wheel of Time.
4604-I finally moved off the Daily servers for both my email and my web hosting.
4605-The email wasn't a big deal since Yahoo is free and I just forward everything from umich anyway.
4606-Keep emailing me at mbibik at umich dot edu, since I might not stay with Yahoo.
4607-The web hosting, on the other hand, was a big deal.
4608-My gallery was taking up at least a gig and no host would charge less than $39/month for that much space.
4609-Well, I found a free host for most of my site and then I'm hosting the galleries at home (thus the mbibik.dyndns.org URL).
4610-No, I can't tell you where I'm hosting, but you can sort of figure it out if you are smart.
4611-Kat and I have been up and down lately, but she is in Italy for two weeks so hopefully things will improve (absense makes the heart, blah blah blah).
4612-Unfortunately, she had a slight hiccup with her flight plans!
4613-Her flight from Seattle to Chicago left on time, but due to weather it couldn't land and had to circle for an extra two hours.
4614-This made her miss the connecting flight from Chicago to Rome!
4615-Her sister flew in from North Carolina so they could fly together to Rome so she skipped the flight to be with Kat.
4616-Now they are both trying to find another flight to Rome.
4617-The next direct flight that is available isn't until Saturday night and American Airlines keeps telling them to fly to London and then home for a standby flight to Rome.
4618-No matter what, I would be very upset.
4619-You can't really get pissed since there is no control over the weather, but very upset nontheless.
4620-My car is really pissing me off lately.
4621-Purchased on 06/27/2003 for about $18k and 8 months later it is only worth $10k.
4622-I still owe about that much!
4623-Anyway, it looks like I haven't posted about my car problems over the past few months.
4624-My CEL (check engine light) came on during normal driving.
4625-Nothing seemed amis, but I made a service appointment anyway.
4626-By the time the appointment arrived, the CEL was off.
4627-They took it and ran some tests anyway.
4628-They replaced a fuel hose and said the car should be fine.
4629-I took it home that night and the CEL went back on the very next day!
4630-I waited a couple weeks before making another appointment.
4631-During those few weeks, the CEL would go on for a couple days then go back off for awhile.
4632-Nothing really seemed wrong with the car until I checked my fuel logs.
4633-The car was getting 17 MPG!
4634-This car is rated for 27 MPG, so something was definitely borked.
4635-I took it in and this time the CEL was on when they received it.
4636-They replaced an 02 sensor and again said the car was fine.
4637-Well, I completely grannied the next tank of gas and got 22 MPG.
4638-Not bad, but not good either.
4639-I went back to my normal driving style and I'm still getting 17 MPG.
4640-I could be driving a WRX for that sort of gas mileage!
4641-I talked to the service tech and he claims he has seens Focii get 17 MPG and there was no solution.
4642-Great.
4643-I finally just decided to ignore the gas mileage since I'm not driving that much anyway.
4644-About two weeks ago, I was simply changing a preset on my radio and it decides to completely freak out.
4645-Now, it goes through this cycle of playing 0.5 seconds of music then turning off for 1.5 seconds, constantly rebooting.
4646-What make its even more annoying is that you have a 0.2 second window while the radio is off to hit the power button so that it will stay off.
4647-I'm sure I can fix it by pulling the plug (disconnect the battery), I just haven't gotten around to it.
4648-How sad is it that my car is worth less than what I currently owe on it?
4649-I mean, obviously that would be the case if I had just bought it or if I paid a very low down payment.
4650-I put down $4k and the car is now 9 months old (and a 2003 model).
4651-Gotta love almost 50% depreciation in less than a year.
1657-Sigh.
4653-urlLink NASIOC Forums - Pulled over in my STI :   Woohoo, same thing happened with an STi!
4654-urlLink evolutionm.net - Ticketed: "Whale Tail" : Haha, if you have an Evo, watch out for pissed off cops in NY.
4655-This guy got ticketed because of his STOCK Evo spoiler!
4656-Anyway, one of the members had a pretty cool sig:  "1 turbo, 2 liters, 3 diamonds, and 4 doors."
4657-urlLink Welcome to P.F.
4658-Chang's China Bistro :   P.F.
4659-Chang's is finally accepting reservations!
4660-I remember the good ol' days of putting in a name at 4:30 PM and eating at 10 PM.
4661-Ahh, the memories, so inefficient.
4662-urlLink Rockstar Games Announces Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas :   Woohoo!
4663-Having the next GTA set in San Andreas isn't shocking since the original GTA was in three cities:   Liberty City, Vice City and San Adreas.
4664-I still remember the day that Chris brought over his copy of GTA:3 for Joe and I to try.
4665-He had to take it away from us a few weeks later since he was going to re-gift it, but I went right out and bought another copy.
4666-Joe eventually traded it in for GTA:Vice City but I was never as impressed with VC.
4667-It just didn't have the same feeling since the character that you played actually had a voice and some emotion.
4668-I much rather enjoyed the voiceless character in 3.
4669-Thus, I bought another copy of 3!
4670-I just need a PS2 to go with it now...
4671-Setting:   A Gameworks or some sort of gaming facility.
4672-Lots of old people, dimly lit, similar to a casino in that respect.
4673-Basically, it had the feel of a Gameworks, casino and bowling alley combined.
4674-First scene:  I'm sitting down and playing some sort of matching game, seems like Mastermind, with quarters.
4675-An older lady approaches from nowhere and demands to know where my gamer card is (If you have been to Gameworks or Dave  Busters, you know that instead of using quarters, you get a credit card of sorts that you can put money on.
4676-I show a pocket full of quarters, implying that I'm just playing with quarters and she storms off.
4677-She returns about 5 minutes later and hands me a large stack of gamer chips (4 $25, 2 $10, 2 $5, 4 $1) and a fist fill of Twizzlers.
4678-The look she gives me as she walks off was, "I've been in your place before, kid.
4679-Have some fun and enjoy the sugar!".
4680-Possibly she thought I was poor since I only showed about 5 dollars with in quarters.
4681-I vaguely remember winning a lot of money on the Mastermind game and then being given a tour of the facility.
4682-The man in charge was giving the tour and reminded me of  urlLink Tom Poston  from the Newhart show, but with a suit that Rod Roddy would wear.
4683-Well, a suit he would have worn, since he  urlLink died  of breast cancer.
4684-During the tour, I remember passing by a small room in the back with mirrors on the walls and a rainbow motif adorning the ceiling.
4685-He said that was in case anyone felt like dancing and could also be rented out.
4686-Oddly enough, it was empty and the lights were off.
4687-I can only imagine how those rainbows would look with the full house lights!
4688-I know I would want to shake my groove thang, and probably go suck on a popsicle or eat some sausage.
4689-Second scene:  The dream gets fuzzy for a bit, but I remember after the tour there was this one counter way in the back with no one around it.
4690-The person running it is none other than Beth Manoongian, an "acquaintance" from school.
4691-This game was a trivia game with a twist.
4692-The questions are extremely difficult but the prize for answering a single question runs in the millions of dollars.
4693-I decide to give it a shot, hoping that Beth will help me out a little bit.
4694-As she pulls the question from a long box of cards, she places it on ledge face down in front of me, then gets a phone call.
4695-While she isn't watching, I try to see what the answer is, but can't quite make it out.
4696-It looks like "Yeh" to me backwards.
4697-The question was something like "What is the beach on Jo Beach?".
4698-Sort of a trick question, but I thought I already had the answer.
4699-I hem and haw for a bit, then exclaim "Yeh!".
4700-The answer was actually "Lev", which doesn't make sense to me in the dream or in the waking world.
4701-Since playing the game is free, I have her pull out another card.
4702-By this time, someone else has joined me at the counter.
4703-This person seemed to be between 18-22 years old, male, dark hair, reminded me of a frat boy.
4704-The next question wasn't even a question, it was something along the lines of "(SomeForeignName) is furious."
4705-I think the riddle was that you had to figure out the country that would give out a name like that then give the translation for "furious".
4706-The random guy and I looked at each other trying to figure it out and then I woke up.
4707-I should rent out my brain for studies into the abnormal.
4708-So the first inline hockey game was yesterday!
4709-Lee and I got there 1.5 hours early so that we could sign up for the league, meet the team and do a little bit of practicing.
4710-The facility is fairly ghetto, located in what looks like an old warehouse.
4711-It is seperated into a little practice field for soccer, the inline rink, then a larger soccer field.
4712-The rink itself is in good condition with an interesting plastic flooring that reminds me of the plastic used for milk crates or toddlers blocks (not the shiny kind).
4713-We only got about 20 minutes of practice in, but it was tiring.
4714-I know that when I got off the rink at the start of the game, I was drenched in sweat.
4715-We ended up losing 5-4, but I scored twice and Lee scored as well!
4716-We both received praise during and after the game which made us both feel a bit better about playing.
4717-Everyone seems very nice and laid back which is exactly what I was hoping for.
4718-Our first practice is tomorrow (yes, we had a game before we practiced) so hopefully my sore knee and arm feel better!
4719-urlLink New Scientist : Does anyone else find it completely asinine that tobacco is the number one killer in the United States, accounting for 18.1% of all deaths in 2000?
4720-Does anyone else find it completely asinine that obesity is about to overtake tobacco as the number one killer?
4721-Also, 64% of Americans are overweight or obese.
4722-Pathetic.
4723-Ironic that I'm posting this to the web while sitting on my ass, but I'm not overweight, you pudgy MFs!
4724-urlLink New Scientist :  It looks like the "fact" that mammals do not produce new eggs after birth may be incorrect.
4725-With a study done on mice, it appears that the number of living eggs decreases too rapidly for the number of eggs available at birth to persist until menopause.
4726-To test if new eggs were created, an ovary from a normal mouse was inplanted into a mouse that was genetically modified to generate a glowing protein in all new cells.
4727-After transplant, eggs were observed with the glowing protein, practically confirming that new eggs are created after birth.
4728-An update to my hockey purchase:  a detailed cost breakdown!
4729-Item  Price    Helmet w/ cage  $99.95    Inline hockey pants  $79.95    Girdle  $64.95    Gloves  $49.95    Shin guards  $39.95    Elbow pads  $29.95    Hockey bag  $29.95    Cup  $3.95    TAX  $35.48     TOTAL    $434.08      As a side note, I understand spending almost $100 to protect my noggin, but only $4 to protect my bits?
4730-Ok, so my friend Alicia got hit on by a guy at a party last week, but they didn't exchange digits.
4731-Instead, since this guy is a complete putz, asked a mutual friend for her AIM screenname!
4732-She isn't going to date him, but they have talked a bit and she found out he has a vanity site:   urlLink Morris Singer .
4733-Signs you are a PUTZ:  You place a picture of yourself in your title graphic.
4734-Your site is "Under Construction":  No one with a modicum of web design ability has used "Under Construction" on their site since 1995.
4735-Go put your crap on GeoCities.
4736-You copy  urlLink all of your columns , and screw it up!
4737-How many instances of "Restroom Revolution Gathers at Stonewall" are on that page?
4738-Hard hitting journalism, at that!
4739-Your  urlLink photo galleries  are Javascript pop-up driven garbage.
4740-Your  urlLink bio  is written in third person perspective.
4741-You do not have a job or a degree yet you have a  urlLink business card .
4742-Your tagline is a warning:  "Thank you for visiting my site.
4743-Do not duplicate this information, content or design without written permission from me."
4744-Yeah, I know, someone could rip apart my site as well, but I can take it.
4745-Well, I just joined an inline hockey league!
4746-We have games every Tuesday, starting tomorrow, for 12 weeks at  urlLink Arena Sports .
4747-Lee introduced me to the team and we are both going to be on the core roster.
4748-I was originally on the substitute list but someone from the core team dropped out.
4749-So, I've played a lot of street hockey, but I've never played on a team or in any sort of organization fashion.
4750-The closest I've come to organization was playing at Elbel Field in Ann Arbor where they kept a list of players.
4751-First come, first serve, so as a person decided to take a break, the next person on the list got to hop in.
4752-That pales in comparison to a real league, so I cannot even imagine what I'm in for tomorrow night.
4753-I've watched enough hockey in my life to know what to do!
4754-Right, I'll be just fine.
4755-No worries.
4756-I'm going to die.
4757-Anyway, Russ and I decided that hockey is the most expensive game to play that does not require an animal (polo, cockfighting, etc).
4758-I already owned skates and a stick, I didn't buy top of the line gear and I still spent $435 dollars.
4759-Things I needed: helmet, elbow pads, cup, girdle, shin pads, inline pants and a hockey bag.
4760-I better play this game for more than a season...
4761-I'm a dork, so of course there are  urlLink pictures .
4762-urlLink Amazon.com: Restaurants :  I'm not really sure what to make of this just yet, but Amazon now has the full menu of almost every restaurant in the greater Seattle area on their site.
4763-Reminds me of the  urlLink monkey.org page for Ann Arbor , but Amazon has almost 800 menus to monkey's 45.
4764-I wonder if the menus are ever updated, considering places like  urlLink Waterfront Grill  changes their menu nightly.
4765-Well, I just checked the menu for Waterfront and it advertises an event on July 16th, 2002, so that answers the question about updates but also poses the question of how long has Amazon had this feature?
4766-What else does Amazon offer that I have missed all this time?
4767-I know they do  urlLink movie showtimes , oddly enough, as well.
4768-Consumerist Whore:  So awhile back, I sold my GameCube, memory card, Metroid Prime (wanted to write "Metroit Prime", too much time spent in the Motor City, I guess), Super Mario Sunshine and Prince of Persia to GameStop for a whopping $101.
4769-When you sell used games and consoles, they give you store credit.
4770-This credit comes in the form of a receipt with a unique alphanumeric.
4771-When the cashier gives you said receipt, he/she is supposed to impart the words of wisdom "DO NOT LOSE THIS."
4772-Well, I lost it!
4773-Luckily, I was dorky enough to write down said alphanumeric and GameSpot was able to reissue the receipt.
4774-Let's see how long it takes before I lose it again.
4775-Anyway, the point of this post was that I went to the mall to get the reissued receipt and ended up going shopping for myself.
4776-I ended up buying two pairs of stain, spill and wrinkle resistant pants at the Gap and three shirts over at Express.
4777-When I went to the get the receipt reissued, the manager said that he woudl probably call me on Tuesday with the reissue since he has to call corporate and they are closed on the weekend.
4778-Turns out, they were open today so he told me to come pick up the receipt.
4779-Another trip to the mall, and we all know what that means... more shopping.
4780-I hadn't run into J.
4781-Crew or Banana Republic since I was in a bit of a rush last night.
4782-Ended up buying my second pair of jeans, making that two pairs purchased in the past 8 months, my first pairs in at least 8 years!
4783-J.
4784-Crew jeans are just about the only ones that fit me even close to well.
4785-Jamie and I must have spent at least two hours looking for that first pair.
4786-Actually, I think that only J.
4787-Crew works for jeans, Gap works for casual pants and Kenneth Cole works for dress pants.
4788-Anyway, I ended up spending $50 for an undershirt and two pairs of boxers at Banana Republic.
4789-Even I realize that's a waste of money, but they were cute and everyone needs underwear, right?
4790-Mmmm,  underwear...
4791-So my radio crapped out awhile ago, probably at least a month ago, and I just today brought it in to be fixed.
4792-When I dropped it off, the technician sait it would be ready this afternoon.
4793-Around 2 PM, he called to tell me that he couldn't fix it, couldn't find a replacement and had to send it out to be fixed.
4794-He had no ETA as to when it would be back, so he said to come pick up the car.
4795-Well, I have the car, but  urlLink no radio or CD player !
4796-urlLink Sonics Dance Team :   Click on Tricia;   Last night, Mark Jen tried picking her up at Tap House in Bellevue.
4797-They talked for a little while, then Tricia and her friend left.
4798-So, by now you have probably heard that Nintendo's next handheld will have two screens and be called the DS (D = Dual/Double S = Screen).
4799-Take a look at this  urlLink mockup  posted to Gizmodo.
4800-The angled design immediately screams to me "This is better because it is different!
4801-", but just think about the ergnomics.
4802-Hold your hands in front of you as if you were trying to hold something a bit smaller than a paperback book, lengthways.
4803-You don't curl your wrists outward and your fingers upward, as you would have to with this design.
4804-I can see a large number of young gamers developing carpal tunnel if this design got the green light.
4805-(I'm going to refrain from jokes about other causes of carpal tunnel in young male gamers.)
4806-A common question about the Pocket PC Phone that I carry around is "Can it play games?"
4807-Well, the answer is yes, but why bother?
4808-The overall form factor is wrong, requiring you to interlace your fingers to hold the device with two hands.
4809-Additionally, there is a directional pad and four buttons, but the pad only supports the four cardinal directions (not diagonals) and two of the buttons are toward the top of the screen.
4810-Basically, I wouldn't even try playing pong on this thing.
4811-Hell, I have nethack install on it and even that is impossible to play.
4812-"2 + 2 = 5 for large values of 2.
4813-", why do I find that so humorous?
4814-urlLink Penny Arcade!
4815-:   By far, the best description of those self-cleaning litter boxes.
4816-Quotes of Note:  "the tiny pot roasts my cat leaves behind", "sometimes it is flung out, as through by catapult, toward imaginary foes", and "It is the sort of thing you would design if you had only a vague description of a cat and you didn't really give a fuck if it worked or not."
4817-In response to my away message:  "Why do all girls have the crazy?
4818-":  Lee (11:35:43 PM): i think girls impact male productivity more than disease Jenn (8:34:51 AM): you sure know how to pick 'em Meg (6:36:39 AM): I'll admit to having the crazy :-) Krista's away message: I like Mike's away message "why do all girls have the crazy"          
           Woohoo, go  urlLink Markko !
4819-He only one a single stage of the entire rally, but "slow and steady wins the race".
4820-Ok, in all actuality, having your strongest competitor get slapped with a  urlLink 5 minute penalty  wins the race.
4821-If you don't want to read the link, basically Petter Solberg had some electrical issues before the start of a stage.
4822-He and his codriver tried to push the car uphill to make it to the starting line in time.
4823-There were already 4 minutes late, giving them a 40 second penalty when the officials realized they received help from the spectators to reach the starting line.
4824-That tacked on an additional 5 minute penalty eventhough neither the driver nor codriver asked for the help.
4825-With a final time difference of 3 minutes and 14.7 seconds from Markko Martin, Solberg would have won.
4826-As Russ said, he probably wouldn't have pushed so hard if it wasn't for that 5 minute and 40 second penalty.
4827-Why am I cooler than you?
4828-Thanks for asking!
4829-Well, do you have the Knight Rider theme song as your ringtone?
4830-Nope, didn't think so.
4831-Dream Update:  The dream from last night concerned me entering some sort of car show.
4832-The show was held in a building similar to Cobo Hall where the North American International Auto Show is held.
4833-The first part of the dream is quite fuzzy, but it involved Jeff, Russ and I driving quite a long distance from home to the show, trailering my show car.
4834-The car was a fairly sedate blue; brighter than Ford Racing blue but not as bright as Subaru World Rally blue.
4835-I have no idea what type of car it was, though my mind told me it was an Acura RSX.
4836-I'm not even sure what sort of car show it was, but I knew that I had to perform something.
4837-Possibly just drive it around for show, possibly drag race it, possibly drift it, who knows!
4838-After we got to the show, there was quite a bit of time before I had to drive, so we walked around.
4839-As we walked around, I realized that I had forgotten the keys to the show car!
4840-Since it was trailered there, I didn't need the keys.
4841-Oddly enough, I found out that I was carrying one of my old keys from the Michigan Daily and it worked as a master key for the entire showroom building.
4842-Again, oddly enough, all of the mens bathrooms were closed so all of the womens bathrooms became co-ed.
4843-While Jeff, Russ and I were walking back down to the parking garage so that we could go get the keys to the show car, we ran into a group of about six people.
4844-We were in a small hallway at a bend, so it was a tight fit to get all 9 people through.
4845-The groups sort of collided, then the six people swarmed us.
4846-My first thought was to check our wallets.
4847-They didn't actually steal our wallets, but Jeff had lost all of his IDs and all of his money except for singles.
4848-Just at the end of the altercation, I some how stole back all of Jeff's IDs and a huge stack of money.
4849-I checked my wallet at this point, and it actually had more money in it than before!
4850-At first, I was pleased, then I checked the bills.
4851-A 300 hundred dollar bill?
4852-Another bill that had multiple denominations on it (I remember one that had "$300", "$133" and "$16" all on the same bill)?
4853-Another bill that had some sort of religious message on the back instead of a visual scene?
4854-This was where I woke up.
4855-Ok, ok, I know that WAPCE is not a terribly common acronym, but since when did DTB become common!?
4856-Christ.
4857-WAPCE: Women Are Pure Concentrated Evil DTB: Dump The Bitch
           I am absolutely amazed by this  urlLink review  of Dawn of the Dead.
4858-Not because it is a bad review, not because it is a funny review, not because the review is dramatically wrong but because this is a review for parents.
4859-This is one of the most gore-filled movies I have ever seen, lots of swearing, some nudity and sexual situations and all of the other great things that give movies an R rating.
4860-There is even a handy table listing issues such as "Profanity", "Nudity/Sex" and even "Diversity Issues."
4861-You would figure that the review would be horribly opposed to anyone young seeing this and especially not making this family affair.
4862-Au contrair, the review is suprisingly positive without a lick of conservative America "hide your children from this filth" opinion.
4863-The review even gives discussion topics if this movie is seen as a family!
4864-"Families who watch this movie might wish to discuss the different approaches taken by the survivors and the range of choices that they make.
4865-Are there times when the moral answer is at odds with the instinct to survive?
4866-How would you handle this variance?"
4867-I am amazed, and quite proud, of this site.
4868-I knew the addiction wasn't going to get any better when I would think back to those lovely days when I owned a video game console.
4869-All those levels beat, all those new trophies acquired, all those end-bosses defeated...
4870-I needed a console, and fast!
4871-I ended up using my $101 store credit at GameStop to buy a refurbished PS2 with network adapter and another copy of Gran Turismo 3.
4872-I still had my saved game from when Joe and I co-owned a PS2, so I fired that up.
4873-Last night, I ended up beating all of the rally levels.
4874-I used the same car for all of the levels:  a heavily modified Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII GSR, putting out about 542 HP.
4875-There are 10 tracks on the rally circuit, 3 races per track and 2, 3 and 5 laps per race.
4876-That means 300 rally laps to complete the entire circuit.
4877-My car couldn't handle as well as most of the rally cars on gravel, but the sheer power got it through those tracks without fault.
4878-On tarmac, the car could handle at least as well as the rally cars and I still had a huge power advantage.
4879-The prize for getting all first places on the 30 different races is the  urlLink Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version .
4880-You'd think a Suzuki would be a horrible prize car, but mine is currently modified to put down 1881 HP!
4881-Top speed is currently 278.9 MPH, nice.
4882-I am genuinely curious to know, on average, how many people a person knows (basically friends and family) that have committed suicide?
4883-Personally, I believe I only know of one person.
4884-I say believe because I have a very good ability to block out many harmful events.
4885-I only know of one person that committed suicide at my high school during the four years I was there and I didn't actually know the person, so they aren't on my list.
4886-There was a discussion I saw online and some people knew upwards of nine people that had ended their lives.
4887-I guess that high of a number just made me think.
4888-I'm still thinking.
4889-Car hunt update:  I got to ride along on two test drives today.
4890-I say ride along since I had Jeff drive them for me!
4891-I suck at manual so I didn't feel like embarrassing myself.
4892-First was the '89 Mitsubishi Colt.
4893-The exterior was decent with just a few bit of rust along the faded paint.
4894-The interior, on the other hand, was well aged.
4895-Not well aged like a wine, cheese, or whiskey, but well aged like that a high school cafeteria mom.
4896-Bits of plastic were broken in just about every spot, including the turn indicator.
4897-It was so broken that Jeff could barely get it to work at all.
4898-The engine was in pretty good shape, but the clutch was really soft.
4899-Next up was the '92 Camaro.
4900-The owner was about 10 minutes late, but all was forgiven when I saw the quality of this car.
4901-There is a slight dent just behind the driver side door that is starting to rust and there is a modicum of rust above the rear passenger wheel well.
4902-Other than that, the vehicle looked practically new!
4903-The interior was a bit worn, but no damage.
4904-The clutch was in good shape, the stereo is brand new, the tires are new, the battery is new and most of the suspension was new.
4905-Needless to say, I was pretty impressed.
4906-It was only an RS, which means that it has 140 HP but 180 lb-ft of torque (and still better than the 130 HP and 135 lb-ft in my Focus!).
4907-Since the car is in such good shape, I really doubt that I will be able to talk him down from the $2,000 price.
4908-Considering how impressed I was with the car, I called up my insurance agent.
4909-If I add a second car to my policy, it will drop the price on the Focus from $672 to $637.
4910-Full coverage on the Camaro would be $298 and just the basics will get run me $198.
4911-Not that bad at all!
4912-I was originally considering paying for a parking spot in a lot near my apartment, but then I realized that I should be able to park at work.
4913-As long as I swap cars at least once a week and move the cars around every other day, I shouldn't get in trouble from security.
4914-As soon as they say something, I will pay for the lot ($50/month).
4915-If I don't think of anything I've forgotten and no one else says this is a dumb idea, I think I'm going to buy it on Monday.
4916-I'd love to have it for the weekend, especially while Kat is gone, but I really shouldn't make a rash decision.
4917-The fourth FloorBurn game was last night.
4918-We improved our record to 2-2!
4919-Lee and I were back on a line again, but we just weren't in sync.
4920-I was playing too far away from him and he wasn't able to get the puck up to me.
4921-No matter what, I stole the puck deep in their end, deked the goalie and got my fourth goal of the season.
4922-We ended up winning 4-1 and team morale was much higher than any other night.

4927-I cannot link to the cars since they are on an internal site, but I can tell you that one is a '92 Camaro and the other is an '83 Supra!
4928-It would be cool to say that I owned a Supra, no matter what model year it is.
4929-Both are in fairly decent shape, at least from what I was told.
4930-The Supra needs a muffler, but that can't be more than $200 to replace.
4931-I should be able to test drive both of them this week.
4932-Maybe I will end up buying a car this week!
4933-I'm looking for a used car!
4934-No, even with all of the problems with the Focus, (which I've since named Sanchez, since the car was made in Mexico and now I can make all sorts of "Dirty Sanchez" jokes) I am not thinking of replacing it for a used car.
4935-I'm actually looking for an old manual car so that I can get better with an MT before I get a real car.
4936-I figure, why not spend upwards of $2,000 on a used car, practice driving a manual, then sell it off for upwards of $1,500 rather than spending $1,200 on clutch replacement for a new car?
4937-There is a parking lot a block away from my apartment where I can get a space for only $50/month.
4938-I will put the least amount of insurance on it, so it shouldn't be too expensive of a proposition.
4939-Here are the cars I've shown an interest in so far:   urlLink 1995 Saturn SL 2   urlLink 1989 Honda Civic   urlLink 1987 Honda Accord

           I purchased my  urlLink hockey skates  (image) last year when Eric and I decided to get back into inline hockey.
4945-The wheels that the skates came with weren't bad (Labeda Shooters) and the bearings were satisfactory (ABEC 3 rated, the lowest rating but there are worse bearings out there that aren't even rated!).
4946-I had used the wheels quite a bit playing outdoor inline, so they were quite worn down:    urlLink      The first two games of the indoor inline season were played on those wheels.
4947-Needless to say, I fell a handful of times.
4948-It took a few weeks of online bargain hunting, but finally I picked up a new set of wheels and bearings.
4949-Out with the old:    urlLink    urlLink      ...and in with the new:    urlLink    urlLink      Don't the new wheels just look so much better, especially on the blue chassis?

4955-Dream from last night:  I cannot remember the bulk of the dream, but it involved a large number of my friends from both Microsoft and UMich at a presentation of some sort.
4956-Everyone was sitting in rows of chairs waiting for it to start.
4957-I was supposed to drive to this with one of the devs on my team, Matt, but when I got there, he was sitting with Matt Weber.
4958-Just before the presentation started, I remember that I borrowed Jeff's can opener and he needed it back!
4959-I was quite concerned since this was a limited edition can opener.
4960-Oddly enough, there were shelves and shelves of shoe boxes and skiing equipment to the side of the presentation room.
4961-After a frantic search, I finally found the can opener at the bottom of a shoe box.
4962-The can opener was a WRX model in Sonic Yellow, which would explain why I was frantic to find it (the Impreza WRX in Sonic Yellow is a very rare sight).
4963-That doesn't explain why I am having crazy dreams.
4964-FloorBurn improved to a record of 3-2 after our 6-2 win on Tuesday.
4965-I scored twice, so I'm back as leading scorer.
4966-Wall of Meat (flag football) is perfect so far at 2-0!
4967-We had a come from behind win on Saturday with our new quarterback, but I can definitely see the team improving from here out.
4968-I'm getting closer to buying the Camaro.
4969-The owner just needs to get it to pass emissions and then I will almost certainly buy it.
4970-The NY auto show is tomorrow thus I expect information about the 2005 Subarus to be released tomorrow.
4971-Rumor has it that the WRX will go a complete redesign for the '06 model year, so maybe buying an '05 would be silly.

4980-So every three months, the  urlLink Puget Sound Blood Center  sends a Bloodmobile to my campus.
4981-I made an appointment for the first time it came around, but had to cancel it due to a meeting conflict.
4982-The second time it came around, I went to donate without an appointment and they were full.
4983-Finally, I got to donate yesterday.
4984-Since it was my first time donating with them, I had to go through the full screening process, mini interview and all.
4985-Finally, I give blood and they have me lay down for an extra a few minutes afterward since this was my first time with them and all.
4986-The actual process of giving blood went just fine.
4987-As I was laying down resting, my stomach started to feel a bit nauseous.
4988-Suddenly, the nausea got worse and I started to think about asking one of the nurses for something to vomit into.
4989-The next thing I notice, there are three people crowded around me and I've got cold compresses on my neck and chest.
4990-Turns out, I passed out!
4991-I was only out for a few seconds, but it was not a pleasant experience.
4992-Soon after I woke up, I broke out in a cold sweat.
4993-I felt functional about 5 minutes later, but I was definitely tired and out of it for the rest of the day.
4994-I, obviously, skipped my hockey game.
4995-I'm sorry folks, this one just speaks for itself.
4996-David Hasselhoff is going to be making a  urlLink Knight Rider movie , possibly with Ben Affleck playing his son.

4998-Katherine and I went to Daniel's Broiler on Lake Union on Thursday night.
4999-We had a $25 gift certificate, but that really doesn't go very far when the entrees are about $40 each!
5000-The hostess treated us just like any other couple having dinner on a Thursday night, but the waiter had a different idea.
5001-It seems that he saw two kids that were in over their heads and thus he didn't expect a large tip.
5002-Since, in his mind, his tip was already shot, he decided to basically treat us like an annoyance.
5003-Since I was out for a nice dinner, I ordered Perrier to start and I made Kat get some Evian even though she is a tap water kind of girl.
5004-He brought us two glasses and two bottles and didn't even offer to pour for us.
5005-I know, I'm getting prissy here, but come on.
5006-While every other table received warm bread and butter before the meal, I had to specifically request it.
5007-When it finally came, our food was ready not 2 minutes later.
5008-When we ordered wine, he acted as if the only grape product we had ever drank was Welch's.
5009-Thanks buddy, I know the basics of wine, and yes I do know that higher altitude wines come from a more concentrated grape.
5010-He got most of our order correct, but he switched how Katherine and I liked our meat (I ordered medium and she ordered medium-rare and he switched them).
5011-Kat has eaten at Daniel's probably ten times and she said this was the first time they didn't offer to cut the meat at the table to show that it was cooked properly.
5012-Maybe he knew he had messed up.
5013-No matter what, our waiter was still not the most annoying part of the evening!
5014-Soon after we had sat down, a pair of gentlemen were seated directly behind us.
5015-Our backs were mostly turned to them, but Kat could tell that the older of the two, maybe 45-50 years old, was consistently staring at her.
5016-This skeeved her out a bit, but was soon ignored.
5017-After we had finished our entree and started to dig into some creme brulee, our waiter approached carrying two glasses of red wine.
5018-He informed us that the man behind us offered two glasses of his fine Argentinean wine.
5019-We raised our glasses and turned to the man and thanked him.
5020-He said "Enjoy, or as we would say in Norway, Skord."
5021-At this point, we felt fairly awkward.
5022-Here was two men that had offered us nice wine and now expected us to at least talk to them.
5023-I basically told Kat to hurry up and drink the wine so we could say a quick word with them and then get the hell out of there!
5024-Kat didn't want to gulp the wine, figuring that would be even more rude.
5025-Eventually, we started to talk to them while we were all still seated.
5026-He asked if we were here on business and when I replied in the negative, he said "Yes, you two look too romantic for business."
5027-The older man was doing all the talking and when he informed me that his companion was visiting from Norway, I just assumed that he couldn't speak English very well.
5028-The older man then complemented Kat on her looks and said something about us being an attractive couple.
5029-Kat and were both obviously nervous and annoyed, but we were still stuck talking.
5030-The man finally said something about his wife and then started babbling.
5031-I couldn't understand a word he was saying and Katherine was having trouble hearing, so we basically turned back to our table to finish the wine and escape.
5032-After drinking the last drop, we got up to leave and I approached the man to at least shake his hand.
5033-After shaking, he gently held on to my hand and placed his other hand on my upper arm, basically trapping me there.
5034-He asked if we enjoyed the wine, if we would like to sit down and have another glass.
5035-I told him we had to leave and we basically fled.
5036-At this point, I heard his companion speak and he said something in accent-free English.
5037-He understood the language, he was just being quiet because he was obviously embarrassed by what was going on!
5038-Kat was, understandbly, a bit disturbed by the whole situation.
3869-Ugh.
5040-Okay, okay.
5041-At first, I wasn't going to post anything more about the Elise since it is simply not practical at all, it's $40k and all of the models allocated for this year are already sold out, but this  urlLink review  just takes the cake.

5046-It's not vaporware after all!
5047-How did I get an account, you ask?
5048-Well, it involves Blogger...   That's all I'm going to say.
5049-I've added a few pictures to my  urlLink moblogging gallery  including one of my  urlLink odometer in binary .
5050-That would be 18 miles total and 6.5 on the trip in decimal.

5052-Speaking of cars, I totally forgot to say that I officially own the Camaro now!
5053-I took a few  urlLink crappy pictures ; I will try to get some better ones in the sun soon.
5054-So far, I've only driven the car in the parking garage at work and a few blocks around my building.
5055-I am still pretty horrible with the manual, but I'm getting better.
5056-Last night, Jeff and I took it out for a little spin.
5057-Everything was going fine until I stopped at a stop sign and just couldn't seem to get the car going.
5058-I kept stalling and stalling and stalling.
5059-It felt very weird to me since I was giving it a ton of gas, it just didn't seem like enough.
5060-After about 12 tries I finally got the car going!
5061-It still seemed to be acting up because the revs were so low.
5062-I stopped at the next stop sign and had the same issue!
5063-Finally Jeff hopped in, played with the shifter and turns out, I was in third gear!
5064-I'm just surprised that I actually got it to go that one time.
5065-Oh well, Jeff said the shifter is fairly narrow and thus it's hard to tell which gear you are in.
5066-I just think I am dumb and that is one more thing I will pay attention to when driving stick.
5067-The more I read about the Pontiac Solstice, the more I like it.
5068-Take  urlLink this article  from Autoweek.
5069-They get to test drive a few engineering mules and were quite impressed.
5070-If the car is impressive in 85% complete form and Lutz is driving this home as the most important GM project, the final result is going to be amazing.
5071-UPDATE:  The car may only have 170 HP, but it also have 170 lb-ft in comparison to the 142 HP and 125 lb-ft found in a base Miata.
5072-Even the new Mazdaspeed version only has 178 hp and 166 lb-ft.
5073-While Jeff and I were at the movies tonight, a lady dropped a large handful of change while at the consession stand.
5074-It was at least 50 coins, so I immediately bent down to help her pick it up.
5075-She was a bit older, so she let me pick it all up.
5076-Her husband must have been at the bathroom, because he showed up just as I finished.
5077-They both thanked me and started to walk off.
5078-Just then, I got a good look at her husband.
5079-Turns out, it was Lenny Wilkins!

5082-Pretty cool.
5083-Sorry everyone, the GMail accounts are gone!
5084-My take on GMail.
5085-Ok, I've only been using it for a short while, but I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.
5086-The first issue is that all email is sorted by "conversations", which is basically what everyone but Microsoft and GMail call threads.
5087-For those of you that don't know what that means, a thread/conversation is just what it sounds like, a collection of email messages relating to a specific topic.
5088-On the most basic level, a conversation is an original message and any replies to that message.
5089-Certain mail clients assign a thread ID and thus you can change the message subject and it will still be a part of the original thread/conversation.
5090-Either GMail or Yahoo doesn't support thread ID because I changed the subject on a thread and GMail started a new "conversation".
5091-There are a ton of keyboard shortcuts, which is interesting for a webmail client.
5092-Seeing as I used pine for my email for 6 years, I'm quite used to navigating my email with a keyboard...  in pine!
5093-Using it in gmail isn't as easy as I expected.
5094-There are keyboard shortcuts for navigating various messages and conversations, but very basic actions, like cancelling the composition of a message, has to be done by mouse.
5095-I do love that the keyboard shortcut for reporting spam is the excalamation key...  it just goes so well with most spam: "Ge.t a m.a$siv3 mem.b3r!
5096-buttercup obtuse bingo cxoiuqweijfd4klhjd7"  My natural response is "!".
5097-GMail has a concept of "All mail" and "archive".
5098-The main action for all emails is to "archive" it.
5099-It doesn't place the message in the trash, it doesn't move it to a specific folder, it just moves the email out of your inbox.
5100-The only way to view archived mails is to use the All Mail view.
5101-All Mail shows any mail in your inbox, your sent mail "folder" and anything you have archived.
5102-It does not show any spam or trash emails.
5103-Instead of supporting folders like most email clients (web or desktop), GMail has introduced the concept of "Labels".
5104-Well, I shouldn't say introduced, but this is the first time I've seen it in relation to an email client.
5105-Instead of storing a conversation (see above) in various default or unique folders, you can assign one or more labels to the conversation.
5106-Let's say that you wanted to save all conversations from a specific person in a specific folder and you wanted to save all conversations about a specific topic in a specific folder, what happens if your specifics collide?
5107-Do you try to decide which folder takes presidence?
5108-With labels, you can give the conversation labels for both the sender and the topic.
5109-Like most folder views, there is a list of labels so you can jump to the list of all conversations with a specific label.
5110-GMail also supports filters which works hand in hand with labels.
5111-You can filter on sender, receiver, subject, words in the body and words missing from the body.
5112-The actions you can take are skip inbox (meaning it places the mail into the archive (see above)), apply a specific label or move it directly to the trash.
5113-You cannot mark anything as spam through the filter.One little feature that I saw in their help files but they did not actually implement related to attachments.
5114-Instead of showing the common and generic paper clip icon to denote an attachment, GMail would use an icon to represent the file type of the attachment.
5115-If it was a PDF, the common PDF icon would be used, etc.
5116-I tested this out, and it's just a paper clip.
5117-Shucky darn.
5118-Overall, I'm sure that I will get used to conversation view, labels and archive and be very happy with my free 1000 MB webmail client harnessing Google!
5119-Do you want to try out GMail?
5120-Since GMail is still in a test period, acceptance is by invitation only.
5121-I received my invitation through Blogger, but now that I am a user I can invite two more people!
5122-The first two to contact me get dibs.
5123-(Note:  If you ask via email, I only check once a day and thus it would be faster to txt/IM/call me.
5124-If you email me right away yet I get two phone calls after your email was sent, you ain't getting GMail from me.)
5125-Wow, some guys just have it rough.

5129-Finally, they brought in Marconi and Tiny for the morning program.
5130-About a month after that, The End changed formats and  dropped  them.
5131-Sucks!
5132-At the time, they were on two radio stations, The End and a station in "Porkland" (their infantile name for Portland).

           Angry Cell Phone Customer Trashes Verizon Store POSTED: 11:43 a.m. EDT May 14, 2004  FARGO, N.D. -- A man who said he was fed up with his cellular phone service went to a Fargo mall and started hurling phones across a store, striking an employee and causing more than $2,000 in damage, authorities said.
5136-Jason Perala, 22, of Fargo, told The Forum newspaper that he planned only to yell at employees at Verizon Wireless.
5137-"Then I just lost it," he said.
5138-"I just started grabbing computers and phones and throwing them.
5139-I just destroyed the place.
5140-...
5141-I kind of regret that I did it, but I hope my message got across."
5142-Police said Perala took off his shirt and put on safety glasses before throwing around computers, phones and other items.
5143-One employee was struck in the shoulder by a phone before he and other workers dashed into an office, locked the door and called police, Sgt.
5144-Kevin Volrath said.
5145-Other businesses in the West Acres mall lowered their steel security gates during Thursday's incident.
5146-Perala was arrested without incident and jailed on charges of felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor simple assault.

5152-If they did not believe, Ivan says, than there would exist no incentive or reason for them to practice love and kindness.
5153-If they do not believe, then the only motive for action would logically be self-interest. "
5154-Is that a truism?
5155-Do you believe that, in a mentality lacking love and kindness, the only logical conclusion would be that all actions would be driven by self-interest?
5156-The implication here is that self-interest is inherently a negative characteristic.
5157-Is it not possible that, while looking out for yourself, you can also look out for others?
5158-The man that helps and cares for others may draw greater fortune to himself.
5159-By looking out for others, you are in a way looking out for yourself?
5160-Honestly, there is very little that I do that does not benefit myself in some way.
5161-I doubt there have been more than two cases in the past five years where I have done something that I did not think would ultimately benefit myself.
5162-If I make a sacrifice at work to help someone out, I believe that this action will be remembered and either they would help me out or I would gain better standing in their mind.
5163-If I was to perform community service, it would partially be because I could talk about it later and have others think highly of me.
5164-I'm selfish, but sometimes it benefits others.
5165-Gah, I can't believe I forgot to post this earlier!
5166-So, on Monday, I had a cashier ask me about my age.
5167-Well, it happened again on Thursday!
5168-I was going to Sports Authority to buy an ankle brace for Kat when it happened.
5169-I picked out the brace and headed to the first available cashier.
5170-I paid with a credit card and had to use one of the electronic signature readers.
5171-She told me to keep my card out for signature validation so I also pulled out my drivers license.
5172-My signature never looks right on this electronic devices so I did it just in case.
5173-I guess the cashier looked at my birthdate because when she handed my cards back to me:  "Are you 23, 24?"
5174-"23, why, do I seem older, younger?"
5175-"More mature."
5176-"Any reason?"
5177-I'm 21 and guys our age seem younger.
5178-You dress well, like you made it somewhere, you seem established."
5179-The funny thing is, I was wearing a long-sleeve jersey material shirt (Kenneth Cole, but she couldn't tell that), Gap slacks and black Puma sneakers!
5180-I definitely wasn't sporting "mature" looking attire.
5181-Oh well.

5190-This madness shoots me like bullets smashing glass in a silent movie.
5191-My brain is triggered to wake up if I hear a diesel engine idling outside of my window.
80-Why?
5193-Well, back in senior year, I was sharing a parking permit with a roommate.
5194-I was almost towed twice for parking in my apartment lot without the permit but I heard the idling tow truck and woke up!
5195-Anyway, there was a truck idling outside of my apartment this morning around 7 AM and thus I woke up.
5196-I really shouldn't be posting right now as I should be working on the SEVEN specifications I have to write in the next few weeks.

5198-Anyway, during the daily Jeff-and-Mike lunch extravaganza, something a bit humorous happened.
5199-Jeff and I have a pretty set list of restaurants we go to (Quizno's, Qdoba, Chipotle, Ribeye, Nasai Teriyaki, Red Robin, Matt's Famous, Arby's, Taj Palace, Yen Ching, etc) and some of the places have started to remember us.
5200-Today at one of the usuals, my order number was 29.
5201-The cashier said "29, close to 30...   are you over 30?".
5202-I had remembered from a previous conversation that she said she had been out of school for 10 years and just got her degree last year so I assumed she was about 30 though she looked not a day over 21.
5203-My response was "No, a bit lower", giving her a thumbs down motion.
5204-"29?"
5205-"No."
5206-"27?"
5207-"Nope, lower."
5208-At this point, she just looked at me, scared to give another incorrect answer.
5209-I held up two fingers, said "23" and transitioned to three fingers.
5210-She was quite flabergasted and made some commented about how I looked so much older while she looked so much younger saying that people don't think of her as a day older than 20, 19 even!
5211-Funny stuff.

5214-Just today, Kat and I went to Big Apple Bagels to grab a quick lunch before we both headed off to work (yes, working on a Saturday).
5215-I ordered my usual, a Roma Italian sub and a 32oz Diet Coke.
5216-We were both a bit tired today but I believe I was the one with worse coordiation.
5217-While reaching for my drink, I slightly nudged it.
5218-Thinking I was about to knock it off the table, I made a quick grab for it, hoping to save it.
5219-Instead, I increased the drinks velocity and redirected its destination vector directly toward Kat.
5220-Needless to say, I absolutely drenched her in 32oz of Diet Coke.
5221-Thankfully, she wasn't too upset.
5222-I tried to clean up as best I could, but she was basically covered and nothing could be done.
5223-We quickly finished our meal outside and then went home.
5224-Minus 50 points for me (for the obvious) and plus 50 points for her (or not freaking out).
5225-Found on Fark!
5226-urlLink retroCRUSH: The 50 Coolest Song Parts :  I don't agree with many of the selections (either that or it's just hard to tell from the much-needed but low quality MP3 clips they give you) but over all this is a pretty cool list with some of my favorites.
5227-Favorites include anything by Queen, The Who and Heart.
5228-urlLink What was Number 1 on the day you were born????
5229-:  I remember seeing this site years ago but I don't think I ever blogged it.
5230-Here are some songs: Mine:   Magic  by Olivia Newton-John Kat's:  Pop Muzik  by M Jenn's:  Funkytown  by Lipps, Inc.   (bwahahaha)  Just for kicks, the song 9 months before my birthdate was  No More Tears (Enough is Enough)  by Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer.
5231-Hmm, not sure what to make of that one.
5232-Oh, BTW, my gallery is hosed.
5233-I'm not exactly sure when it happened or what happened, but it's hosed.
5234-I tried to upload some pictures last night and my upload tool kept crashing.
5235-I tried to add the pictures through the normal web interface and that was having some problems.
5236-When I couldn't delete some albums, that's when I knew it was completely messed up.
5237-Even upgrading over the existing installation didn't help.
5238-Looks like I get to rebuild it from scratch this weekend!
5239-Yay!
5240-When you drive to work and get out of your car and then ask yourself "Am I wearing underwear?
5241-", you know it's going to be a good day.
5242-Why the hell did  urlLink The Berry Zone  have to pick the exact same Blogger template as me?
5243-I mean, come on, dude already stole my first name, he doesn't have to be lazy and steal the same damn template!
5244-No matter, it's all love.
5245-Hmm, power to weight ratios, one of the most important aspects of any car.
5246-The Focus only has 130 HP but it only weighs 2551 pounds and has 135 ft-lbs.
5247-The Camaro, on the other hand has only 140 HP and weighs 3103 pounds but has 180 ft-lbs.
5248-A few calculations later give 19.62 pounds-per-HP and 18.90 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Focus and 22.16 pounds-per-HP and 17.24 pounds-per-ft-lb for the Camaro.
5249-The Focus is faster than the Camaro but the Camaro has better low-end acceleration?
3567-Weird.
5251-Now that Russell is moving out and I do not have a roommate yet, my rent goes from $672.50 a month to $1570 a month!
5252-I get to pay $95 a month for the right to a second parking space when I do find a roommate.
5253-I also get the fun of trying to find said roommate which is becoming harder than I expected.
5254-Thanks!
5255-All of the second round of GMail invites are gone!
5256-Try  urlLink Gmail Swap .
5257-Nothing quite like slogging through an array of websites to find out the recommended fuel for your new crappy car.
5258-Considering that the car was produced in 1992, trying to find information about it online is interesting.
5259-Most of the sites that have info are either all-encompasing sites that cover a certain aspect of all cars (safety info, for example), or they are some enthusiast site just for that car or type of car (thus a third generation Camaro).
5260-I finally found that my base V6 engine only requires regular unleaded fuel.
5261-I know the Chevy used to have a 4-cyl Camaro and that would obviously take regular so I figured it was possible that the V6 was mapped for midgrade (89 octane).
5262-Nope, just 87 octane.

5269-Who wants  urlLink GMail ?
5270-I have two more invites (I had three, but Sokol already grabbed one).
5271-urlLink Cop was killed for his gun, authorities say :  This sort of sounds like a movie plot; Ex-marine, Gulf War veteran, stalks/hunts down police officers until he finds a vulnerable one, marine hops out of Camaro and applies a shotgun blast to the head of the cop, steals cop's gun.
5272-What happens next?!
5273-Well, my gallery is officially dead.
5274-I'm in the process of rebuilding it.
5275-Anyway...
5276-Religion is just a meme in the minds of many.
5277-The mind is comprised of a collection of neurons with some capabiilty of memory and higher processing.
5278-The neurons are a physical entity that is controlled by chemicals and electrical pulses.
5279-Viruses can have an affect on chemicals and chemical processes.
5280-Why can't someone just create a virus to destroy religion?
5281-Would it really be that hard?
5282-Please?
5283-As a kid, I absolutely hated a warm pillow.
5284-I would have difficulty falling asleep because by the time I had rested enough to almost fall asleep, the heat of my pillow would annoy me and wake me up.
5285-I would either flip the pillow or sleep on the other end.
5286-In other words, the average pillow had four sectors.
5287-By the time I was done with all four, the original sector had probably cooled down to normal and I could switch to it.
5288-I remember being awake for at least an extra hour some nights because of this.
5289-I no longer have this problem, otherwise I would run out and buy the  urlLink Chillow !
5290-A small, flat but otherwise pillow-shaped insert, the Chillow acts as a heatsink and radiator.
5291-It makes one side cold and one side a bit warm.
5292-The warmth is absorbed by the pillow proper and dissipated leaving the surface nice and chilly.
5293-Hell, I might buy one anyway!
5294-urlLink I AM THE PHANTOM SHITTER : "Good luck, the next round will be worse, and I've started drinking Metamucil. "
5295-Woohoo, three more GMail invites!
5296-I think I might want to try gmailswap soon as the invites seem to be increasing in number.
5297-I had a possible roommate check out the apartment last night.
5298-I cannot ascertain for certain, but I think we might be a good match.
5299-I really hope so, simply because I've had no other leads!
5300-Car update:  I'm getting better at the manual seeing as I haven't stalled yet today (a first!).
5301-I've had some compliments including about the exhaust note.
5302-I'm happy.
5303-I'm really started to get used to the upgraded audio.
5304-The bass response is pretty cool and there is a fairly slick steering column (not steering wheel) based audio controller.
5305-I will probably take a picture of it when I do a full photoshoot later.
5306-Basically, it is stalk sticking out from the lower left area of the steering column.
5307-It has a two-way switch for station seeking (while in radio mode) and track seeking (for CD mode), two buttons for volume control and a single button for mode which will switch between presets for radio mode and will switch CDs for CD mode.
5308-I'm getting used to using it.
5309-Yesterday was my one year anniversary at Microsoft!
5310-Following standard procedure, I brought in a pound of M  Against standard procedure, I actually brought in a pound of M in three different flavors (plain, peanut and crispy (which is crispy in the sense of Nestle Crunch bars: crisped rice)).
5311-It feels fairly odd that I've already been here for a year.
5312-I've done so much, but it also seems like I could have accomplished more.
5313-I shouldn't really complain, there are others that started around the same time I did that haven't done much at all.
5314-There are actually a few people that have started recently (one started two years ago and two others started a year ago) that are leaving the company.
5315-One is getting married, another is going to school and another is starting a company.
5316-It should be publicly known, but Microsoft is reducing their benefits.
5317-It just looks like there isn't enough to keep people around anymore.
5318-Oh man, this  urlLink game  is almost as addictive as penguin baseball.
5319-You try to toss paper into a waste basket, simple enough.
5320-Jeff took a look at my comparison post and asked about the units for the slalom course.
5321-I knew it was MPH but Jeff reasoned that time through the course might be a better value to track.
5322-I figured that average speed was used because different cars will have different acceleration rates, times through the course, speeds and more.
5323-Just using time might be a better indication of cornering ability and power, not just cornering ability.
5324-Anyway, I found this in one of my Motor Trend articles:  Just drive around the cones as fast as your can, right?
5325-Yes-and no.
5326-Try cracking off six perfect, consecutive, emergency lane-changes at freeway speeds (some well above) with a margin of error at less than one inch.
5327-Sure, this sound challenging until one realizes each cone arrives at less than a one second interval-the whole thing takes less than six seconds in these vehicles.
5328-This is one test that best reveals a car's evil side.
5329-A propensity to push, get loose, or even spin is ever more apparent while all four ties are howling at, in some cases, 80 MPH.
5330-That's right, the speeds listed above are timed averages between the entry and exit markers along the 600-foot course-not how fast the car is actually traveling along its curvy line, which is, in fact, much faster.
5331-As you can tell from my last post, I have a new car!
5332-Well, almost new.
5333-Let me tell the story.
5334-About this time last year, I was car shopping.
5335-I had almost signed on an Evo when better judgment told me to go with something cheaper to start.
5336-Also, 271 HP is a bit much for someone that had never driven a manual before.
5337-I decided to use my grandfathers Ford discount and just pick up a Focus.
5338-It had decent looks and handling and the interior was fairly accomodating.
5339-I have yet to find nicer seats (not even in the SVT).
5340-While I was trying to pick out the Focus I wanted, the sales person I was working with kept mentioning the SVT.
5341-When we finally went out to the dealer lot to grab an automatic ZX3 for a test drive, we had to pass over at least five SVTs to find a single ZX3.
5342-Obviously the cars were not selling well.
5343-I bought the Camaro about two months ago and I've only put about 200 miles on it.
5344-I wasn't getting any better at the manual, so I just stopped trying.
5345-I'm always looking at car forums when the SVT was mentioned.
5346-I cannot remember the context but someone was praising it on a Subaru forum.
5347-A car has to be at least moderately respectable for someone entrenched in another manufacturer's camp to praise it.
5348-Just on a whim, I decided to look up new/used SVTs in the area.
5349-The only one I could find was a 2004 model with about 940 miles on it.
5350-I figured that had to be a typo for 9,400 so I figured I'd email the dealer.
5351-Nope, not a typo.
5352-An older gentleman traded in a SVT Lightning for an SVT Focus and then decided it seemed too young for him.
5353-He returned it 3 weeks later.
5354-They gave me an overnight test drive and I decided this is what my car should have been all along.
5355-Tighter (but not punishing) suspension, better brakes, better looks, better acceleration and an amazing transmission.
5356-Going to this car from the Camaro is very eye-opening.
5357-The Getrag trans is just a thing of beauty.
5358-I think the only better transmission out there for under $35k is in the S2000.
5359-The dealership first put the car on the market at $19,995 (or just about what the car cost new) and that didn't fly.
5360-The salesperson also offered me only $7,500 for the ZX3 and an interest rate of 7.49%.
5361-Given those numbers, my monthly payment would have been $677.17!
5362-The price of the car was talked down to $17,500 then $16,900 and finally $16,500.
5363-The trade in on the ZX3 was brought up to $7,750 then $8,000 then $8,500.
5364-The APR was brought down to 6.49%.
5365-After the trade-in, loan payoff (of the ZX3), license, document fees (yeah WTF), taxes and $1,000 down, I had to finance $17,238.75.
5366-With an APR of 6.49%, my monthly payment will only be $528.27.
5367-The more I drive this car, the more I love it.
5368-I am not quite used to the 6-speed but I've had multiple people tell me I'm much smoother in the SVT than in the Camaro.
5369-That is just a put-down in disguise but I'll take it anyway!
5370-Car  Owner  HP  0-60  1/4 mile  600 ft slalom  60-0 braking    SVT Focus  Mike  170  7.4  15.4  66.8   119
           Remeber how I said I almost bought an Evo?
5371-Looks like it was a good cal!
5372-All the bad news about Mitsu has caused their sales to plummet almost  urlLink FIFTY PERCENT  this month and 27% for the year.
5373-Yikes.
5374-Adios, muchachos.
5375-Woohoo, the MPx220 is now officially on Motos website!
5376-Here is the  urlLink press release  and here are  urlLink pictures .
5377-Ok, now that I have a semi-respectible car, I'm thinking about taking it autocrossing.
5378-Let me explain in case you have never heard of autocrossing.
5379-Basically, a tight and twisty course is constructed of cones in a large parking lot.
5380-You rarely go over 60 MPH so this is not a high speed sport.
5381-It focuses on cornering and smooth driving.
5382-I'm definitely not good enough with the manual to consider doing it this year but I plan on checking out a few events so that I know what to expect next summer.
5383-Anyway, check out some of these  urlLink course maps  and you'll get a better idea.
5384-Haha, I love this.
5385-Posting to blogger on my laptop that is connected to my Smartphone through Bluetooth while the Smartphone has internet access through GPRS.
5386-Isn't technology wonderful?
5387-So little time or energy to post!
5388-Suppa happy fun bullets are all you get.
5389-Kat and I didn't do much this Fourth of July weekend.
5390-We both had difficult weeks (especially the night where I left work at 12:45 AM and then was up for the next day before 7 AM) so we just took it easy.
5391-Her parents backyard overlooks much of Seattle so we were able to see four different fireworks displays at once (Elliot Bay, Gasworks, Yarrow Bay and Kirkland).
5392-Tonight was the second game of the summer FloorBurn season.
5393-I'm captain already and I've already made a mistake.
5394-I didn't inform everyone we had a game this week (assuming that the manager would take care of that like last season) and only 4 people showed up.
5395-A couple people subbed for us and we ended up winning 3-1!
5396-I almost had a hat trick but the pass I got right in front of the goal was actually about to go into the goal so I just let it go by!
5397-I've spent about eight hours working on my yearly review for Microsoft and I'm only about a third of the way completed.
5398-It is important but not that important.
5399-I just want a fatty raise so I can afford my new car and my $1,570/month rent.
5400-This happened two weekends ago, but Eric of Jenn fame was in town so Kat, Eric and I grabbed some dinner and dessert.
5401-We had a good time, but it didn't last long enough.
5402-I had an early morning appointment so I had to call the night around 9 PM.
5403-The new car is still super sweet.
5404-To measure how sweet it is, I picked up a  urlLink G-Tech Performance Meter Pro .
5405-I haven't had a chance to try it out yet.
5406-Well, I haven't had a piece of flat, dry, non-cop-infested road to really wring out the car and measure with it yet.
5407-In time.
5408-While the car is still super sweet, the oh-so-smooth shifter is becoming less smooth.
5409-There is some hesitation as the shifter returns to neutral on the way to the next gear.
5410-It almost seems like the linkage is jammed.
5411-Oh well, it should work itself out in time otherwise it is going to the dealer!
5412-I didn't drive this car hard at all yet and I haven't had a gear grind nor have I missed a shift.
5413-If there is a problem, it wasn't my fault.
5414-I've been playing a ton of GT3 lately, now that Russ has moved out.
5415-I can play the really long races or long sets of races and just leave the PS2 running while I go to work.
5416-I can play a bit, do something else then go back to an unmolested PS2.
5417-I've already won an F1 car so now it's basically a game of "How many times can I pass everyone before I win!".
5418-I love that game.
5419-Just in case I decide to care about this crap later, my car is #761 out of 1978 built and was built on 07Jan2004.
5420-I've removed the links to my Gallery as I haven't had time to repopulate it since it was destroyed.
5421-I have added a new album though!
5422-urlLink SVT Focus 07.11.2004   Jeff complained that I used a Microsoft building as my background and not Mt.
5423-Rainier.
5424-I knew that this parking garage would be in full sunlight and completely open.
5425-I can take pictures just about wherever I want and he's a negative fuck anyway!
5426-Now that I have the SVT Focus, I've put the Camaro up for sale.
5427-I have so far only posted it in the Microsoft classifieds but anyone in the Puget Sound area can take a look at these.
5428-I put the car up two weeks ago and I got a phone call last Wednesday:  Her: I'm calling about the Camaro.
5429-Me:  Ok, it's still available.
5430-Her: Can I come see it?
5431-Me:  Sure, when works for you.
5432-Her: How about this weekend?
5433-Me:  Ok, when?
5434-Her: Oh, I don't know, lunchtime?
5435-At this point, I got a little bit frustrated.
5436-I dont want to hear "lunchtime", I want a specific time and date.
5437-Anyway, I finally got her to decide on Saturday at noon.
5438-She calls me Friday morning (a call I missed since I was in the parking garage) and says that she can't do it on Saturday and that Sunday at 5 PM would work better.
5439-Ok, that is fine.
5440-I get a voicemail Sunday at roughly 4 PM to say she can't make it at 5 PM and would Monday work.
5441-I call her back, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying that Monday would be fine if she would please tell me a specific time.
5442-She emails me this morning to say that either 6 or 7 PM would work.
5443-I told her to give me a specific time and if she was going to change that time to tell me by 2 PM.
5444-She writes back, saying 7 PM would be fine.
5445-Here we are, 5:30 PM and she calls:  Her: Hi Mike, I just wanted to see if we could meet earlier.
5446-Me:  Well, we decided on 7 PM.
5447-Her: I know, but I was wondering if we could meet at 6 or 6:30 PM.
5448-Me:  I already said that I would need to know by 2 PM if you were going to change the time.
5449-Her: I know, I was just wondering if you could get off work early.
5450-Me:  No, but 7 PM works for me.
5451-Her: Ok. Me:  (Cutting her off) Bye.
5452-::CLICK:: Holy cow.
5453-I bet you $100 that she is going to show up 15 minutes late and then not know how to drive a manual transmission.
5454-Just wait.
5455-UPDATE:  She can't drive a manual!
5456-But, this is a car for her (I think) younger brother so I will give her a little slack.
5457-Sigh, I hate moving.
5458-Russ gave me not quite enough notice to find a roommate so I'm moving out.
5459-I even paid the entire rent plus the month-to-month penalty plus the extra parking spot for a month hoping I would find someone.
5460-No such luck.
5461-Katherine has graciously offered living with her for a short while until I find someone else to room with.
5462-I am going to move the majority of my stuff into a storage unit and move the necessities over to her townhome.
5463-Actually, I've already moved most of my hanged clothes and shoes.
5464-Over the weekend, I hope to pack up everything so that I can get a mover next week to bring it all to a storage unit.
5465-No way am I going to try to move my couch, queen bed, bookshelves et cetera by myself.
5466-The real kicker here is that I didn't give my apartment enough notice that I was leaving.
5467-When I went from the year lease to a month-to-month lease, they never said anything about a "twenty day notice".
5468-On a month-to-month, that's a huge amount of notice!
5469-I wanted to move out at the end of July but they are so graciously allowing me to pay $1470 for all of August.
5470-They said that if someone moves into the apartment, they will pro-rate the amount and pay me back.
5471-I somehow doubt that is going to happen!
1657-Sigh.
5473-Ok, really weird dream.
5474-Here are some of the highlights:  Set in a time where USA and the Soviet Union are at a full-on war.
5475-The first part of the dream sees me running across an American battlefield, trying to avoid bullets, mines, bombs, missiles and just about every other type of munition.
5476-I saw a very large passenger jet, presumably American, get hit by a missle and then crash into the sea.
5477-This jet was filled with Olympic athletes.
5478-At this point, the dream becomes more of a movie and I am delegated to observer status.
5479-A rag-tag group of Americans decide that the only way to stop the Soviet Union is to infiltrate their country and kill their leader.
5480-The group of Americans consist of a female Olympic judge, a 12-year-old girl and an older guy that looks like James Earl Jones.
5481-This group has to train to be able to infiltrate the country.
5482-Instead of learning military techniques, they learn how to train water snakes.
5483-I don't remember how, but all of a sudden the entire group is in the heart of the Soviet Union.
5484-The unnamed leader is hiding out in a rural town in a boarding house.
5485-The little girl sneaks upstairs, undetected, to find the leader sleeping amongst 15 other people from the town.
5486-The girl places a rag of some sort of chemical over the leaders mouth, knocking him out.
5487-Instead of just killing him, the girl saws off his head with a dull machete and puts it into a burlap bag.
5488-No one has yet noticed anything has happened.
5489-She sneaks downstairs and runs outside.
5490-Just as she joins the rest of her group hiding behind a bush outside, there is a sound much like the sharpening of a machete.
5491-From an open window upstairs, the now-dead body of the leader with a ghostly head starts to appear in the window.
5492-At first, it's safe to assume he is about to brandish a machete when instead he pulls out a .50 cal machine gun (the type that is normally truck mounted).
5493-Before he can fire, the James Earl Jones character grabs a gun from the ground and sprays the leader with bullets.
5494-The end.
5495-Quick post again.
5496-I went to a RallyCross on Sunday ( urlLink pictures ).
5497-It was fairly interesting, but I'm not subjecting my only car to that treatment.
5498-Today I got my new Microsoft Prime card (discount card for restaurants, hotels, etc).
5499-The old design was fairly metrosexual (polka dots and all) but the new one takes the cake!

250-Even with my flawed vision, the long white metal tube so finely manufactured it could have been a piece of sophisticated medical equipment, let the cloud bands of our solar systems largest planet and the bright points of a handful of its moons into my mind, making me feel a shadow of the shock that Galileo must have felt when he saw the same sight before any of us. "

257-The newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park, had their support, and looked like they might make a successful go of it.
258-I'm the top left corner on Cory Doctorow's  urlLink Four blogs on one page , which is one excuse why I haven't been posting to this blog very much lately.

263-Now in Mindjack, a review of the  urlLink Xircom Wireless LAN Module  for Palm m500 handhelds.
264-A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting.
265-Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience.
266-One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter.
267-Working on an airplane or from a caf just felt wrong.
268-This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station.
269-If you've used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I'm talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you won't go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I've stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I can't choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials).
270-Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all.
271-And it keeps on getting better.
272-802.11 isn't just a technology, it's a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world.
273-Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network.
274-If you're in a major city, chances are you'll find one before you go a block.
275-Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.

303-urlLink Jim Lai reports on Digifest 2002  in the new issue of Mindjack.
304-I didn't have much in the way of expectations going in to Digifest 2002; pretty pictures, glitzy art/advertising pieces, and possibly some cool tech.
305-I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations.
306-Wednesday night.
307-Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen.
308-The theme of this international digital media festival was the "4-D challenge", to go beyond the third dimension.
309-I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension.
310-Now that I've spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself.
311-The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions.
312-There was a soire before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle.
313-Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly.
314-I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool.
315-Business cards flowed like water.
316-I got an iBook!
317-OSX sure takes some ajusting to but I'm really impressed with it so far.
318-urlLink Neil Gaiman  on whether someone should or should not be a writer:  And in answer to your question, if you worry about job security as a writer, that's a very good indication that you aren't a writer.
319-Hating writing is another good one, although I know writers who hate writing.
320-(They are miserable.)
321-In the new Mindjack: a  urlLink report on SXSW Interactive  by Jon Lebkowksy, with photos by  urlLink Paul Bausch .
322-This year's South by Southwest Interactive conference was lean and mean - attended mainly by the core group of edgy 'net whackadistas, the conference had an interesting vibe, like "Wow, glad the goddam dotcom splurge is over, let's get back to what we were doin'" And what we were doin' had real depth, it was way more compelling than ecommerce or net.publishing, the kinds of projects MBAs brought to the table when they started calling the Internet an 'industry' and creating the concept of the IPO casino.
323-Mindjack is back from a short break with a great article by Douglas Rushkoff:  urlLink Conforming to the Machine .
324-If you aren't reading  urlLink futurefeedforward , you should be.
325-NEW YORK--ABC news magazine "20/20" reporter John Stossel, accidentally decapitated late last month while shooting a segment "debunking the myth of wind power," returns to the air Wednesday in a special interview with 20/20 anchor Barbara Walters.
326-"It's really an amazing story," explains Walters.
327-"Most people wouldn't even survive decapitation, let alone have the guts, the determination, to keep doing their jobs.
328-It's a real triumph of the human spirit."
329-Everyone's favorite Cory Doctorow, Cory Doctorow, has gotten a  urlLink new gig  at the EFF, which reminds me that I haven't suported them nearly enough.

331-urlLink Daily Relay  is finally back up.
332-We're using Blogger as an interim solution and will probably switch to Blogger Pro if I can't get the Moveable Type problems sorted out.
333-This week's Mindjack:  urlLink Reading McLuhan  by Melanie McBride.
334-If there's a message of the 'for dummies' age it's that nothing is beyond our grasp.
335-And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation.
336-No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto.
337-With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet.
338-It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times.
339-But in the process, much of McLuhan's meaning has been reduced to a one-liner.
340-This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhan's literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught.
341-The new issue of Mindjack deals with one of my favorite topics:  urlLink Robots!
342-My submission to the  urlLink Burn Baby Burn  mix CD swap, with dispraportionate amounts of Bowie and Reed, of course.
343-urlLink     (click to read tracklist)           
             Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff has started  urlLink a blog .
344-Expect good things.
345-Not that you''d expect anything less, but the  urlLink Criterion Collection  website is really excellent.
346-It's similar the old  urlLink Criterion Goes To The Movies  CD-ROM, which is also worth checking out.
347-Although it takes some work to get it to run on any computer made in the last six or seven years.
348-Both are filled with great essays on some of the best moves ever.
349-We've got a  urlLink great interview with Simon Singh , author of  The Code Book , in the new issue of Mindjack.
350-Gadzooks, it's been a long time since I last posted.
351-Sorry.
352-I interview  urlLink Derek Powazek  in the new Mindjack, in which he talks about online community, his book and weblogs as journalism.

355-More to come soon.
356-urlLink Mindjack  is back!
357-Now to get back to work on this site.
358-urlLink Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis!
359-So why aren't you reading comics these days?
360-Really, it doesn't seem to me that there are many comics being written for me.
361-I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves.
362-The Western medium has cycles, and it's currently in a creative downturn.
363-That doesn't mean there isn't excellent work being done.
364-That simply means there's not much of it.
365-And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me.
366-Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I don't own a pair of Superman underpants.
367-Howard Rheingold  urlLink interviewed on NPR  (RealAudio link).
368-I still haven't gotten my copy of  urlLink Smart Mobs  yet, but hope to soon.
369-Mindjack's Jim Lai checks out an art exhibit in the form of a billboard:  Transmedia 2002's  urlLink 15 Seconds of Fame.
370-Now in Mindjack:   urlLink Cybersecurity Nosebleed  by Sarah Granger "Security is the newest over-hyped commodity in the United States.
371-I keep visualizing driving down highway 101 past billboards that read: "Big government wants big security" along with a picture of an ape beating on its chest.
372-Somehow as seriously as they say they are, I'm not convinced."
373-urlLink Mindjack's back , with a proper relaunch this time after a bit of a slow start last month.
374-We've got a lengthy article on Lawrence Lessig by Bryan Alexander this issue, plus my review of the neat little l'espion digital camera.
375-Spread the word!
376-I'm kicking myself for missing the  urlLink David Bowie concert  on BBC Radio 2 today.
377-But at least I was able to find a couple of the songs  urlLink somewhere else .
378-Bewlay Brothers is amazing.
379-In case anyone's sitting on the edge of their site, rest assured the Mindjack relaunch is still on track for Monday.
380-Get the word out.
381-I can't get enough of CBC's  urlLink 50th anniversary  specials.
382-I wish they'd start a cable channel and show nothing but stuff from the 50s and 60s (and 70s and 80s too).
383-I just got  urlLink Syberia  and  urlLink Post Mortem , two promising new adventure games from Montreal-based developer  urlLink Microids .
384-As you might be able to judge from some of my posts here, I'm a big fan of adventure games.
385-The traditional kind, where you can carry an enormous inventory in your pants, and explore the game at your own pace.
386-I've been thinking a lot about the genre lately and plan to write something about it soon, aside from reviews of the aforementioned games.
387-I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on adventure games.
388-Do you think there's a place for them today?
389-What are your favorite games?

             This doesn't bode well for me getting much work done this weekend.
391-The Adrenaline Vault's  urlLink Best Shareware of 2002          
             Justin Hall on South Korea:  urlLink korea will be televised .
392-TVs in cabs, TVs in subways, and stacks and stacks of tiny, tiny televisions to take with you.
393-But I was still able to enjoy more television, this time in the Seoul subway.
394-Televisions up in the subways, instead of static ad bulletin boards!
395-This is the future!
396-It's fun to see and fun to watch now.
397-Soon it might be annoying or normal.
398-But this first brush with more constant televisual stimulation was definitely exciting.
399-I'd like to comment on  urlLink Movielink , the new studio-approved online movie rental service, but unfortunately this is all I'm able to see:           
             Sign #249  urlLink CNN  needs some sense slapped into them:  it's the day after an election, Republicans have taken control the Senate, Dick Gephardt is stepping down as House minority leader and right now, on Larry King, they're talking about the Winona Ryder verdict.
400-At least they took down the  BREAKING NEWS  graphic.
401-There's a  urlLink new trailer  for Steven Soderbergh's  Solaris  up today -- one of the movies I'm most looking forward this fall.
402-I got a copy of the great DVD release of Tarkovsky's  urlLink original film  from  urlLink The Russian Cinema Council  a short while ago.
403-Which I hope to review for Mindjack before the new film's released.
404-Cory Doctorow  urlLink reviews Smart Mobs  in the new Mindjack:    Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist.
405-A squillion like-minded souls who don't know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice, roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers, without leaders, without manifestoes or forethought.
406-Also this issue, an in-depth look at  urlLink the Internet Archive  by Doug Roberts.
407-Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three.
408-Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling.
409-To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Baker's racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on it's side to maximize the space.
410-Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully.
411-Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, it's easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today.
412-Mindjack is back after a short break.
413-The new issue has  urlLink a report  on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts.
414-Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days.
415-The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future.
416-Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example.
417-No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system.
418-Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade.
419-By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging.
420-I just discovered through  urlLink Smartmobs.com  that Clive Thompson has a  urlLink blog .
421-It's great.
422-Which reminds me, I really need to update the blogroll on this site.
423-Doug Roberts is covering  urlLink Supernova  for Mindjack and  urlLink blogging it live .
424-Sometimes Amazon.com is just plain eerie.
425-If you're going to be in Los Angeles on February 15, don't miss  urlLink Live from the Blogosphere , a panel discussion to be put on by Rhizome.LA and moderated by Xeni Jardin.
426-"Live from the Blogosphere!"
427-brings together six innovators in blogging: Mark Frauenfelder, Heather Havrilesky, Evan Williams, Susannah Breslin, Doc Searls, and Tony Pierce.
428-The panel will discuss the birth of blogging, the emergent tension between blogs and traditional journalism, innovations in blogging such as video-blogging, audio-blogging, and mobile-blogging, the shifting roles of race and gender in the Blogosphere, the state of the blog economy, and the way blogs may be reshaping contemporary media.
429-(cross-posted from  urlLink Daily Relay )         
             I review a cool laptop bag today in  urlLink Daily Relay .
430-Douglas Rushkoff meets Al Gore and is  urlLink suitably impressed .
431-He was a much brighter, open-minded, and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for, before.
432-I felt like he was really one of "us," if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world, and even beyond, is connected somehow.
433-And evolving.
434-Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality.
435-New Mindjack up today!
436-Cory Doctorow on  urlLink William Gibson .
437-Justin Hall on  urlLink Super Monkey Ball 2 .

440-urlLink Shift magazine publishes its last issue .
441-Shift has pulled out from dire situations before, but this looks to be the end, which is a real shame.
442-They've been a consistently great magazine and an important voice in the ever-changing sphere of digital culture.
443-The final issue is due out in two weeks, I urge everyone to pick up a copy.
444-Mindjack's been  slashdotted .
445-urlLink The Fray  redesigned for the first time in over six years.
446-Blog coming soon.
447-urlLink Deepsky  have posted their remix of David Bowie's "I Took a Trip an a Gemini Spaceship" on their website.
448-Not as good as the original, but worth a listen.
449-urlLink RealAudio link          
              urlLink This post  by Warren Ellis to his blog isn't just cool because he linked to Mindjack:  At Bruce Sterling's house in Austin, Texas, Howard Waldrop beams Cory Doctorow an mp3 of some swampy old rock'n'roll from the dawn of time.
450-The next day, across town, his powerbook scorching the flesh off his legs, he beams it over to me in England.
451-I put it up on a private server for Fraction in Kansas City and Laurenn in San Francisco, while reading the first few chapters of Cory's new book, which he sent to me from an airport a few days before, squatting by the power outlet next to the public toilets.
452-urlLink continued...           
             Slashdot launches  urlLink games.slashdot.org  and, holy cow, it's ugly.
453-Mindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on  urlLink ethics in video game journalism  for the Online Journalism Review.
454-The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981.
455-Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.  Not much has changed in the past 20 years.
456-Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics.
457-This is incredible.
458-Scientists have discovered a "Colossal" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found.
459-And it's not even fully grown.
460-Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration.
461-Just imagine that there's something like this that no one has ever seen alive.
462-It's interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel.
463-While it's great there's some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more.
464-Googling for sites that mention Mindjack, other than mindjack.com, suprisingly results in 5,800 links.
465-I like the description on  urlLink this one .
466-Mindjack Magazine.
467-One pusle showing the osmotic swelling of Digital culture as the norm.

487-I've also started a  urlLink Mindjack group  as a bit of an experiment.

509-Also, we're constantly looking for great new writers.
510-If you want to write for us, drop an email.
511-I'm pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjack's ever-growing stable of writers.
512-His first article,   urlLink Redefining Television  , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium.
513-Here's a snippet:   In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in  1984  and Ray Bradbury in  Fahrenheit 451  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda.
514-And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they weren't that far off the mark.
515-But here's the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered.
516-Actually, they've already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this.
517-To understand why, we need to go back to first principles.
518-What is television?
519-Here's a functional definition:   Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images.
520-This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era.
521-Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies.
522-I'm using this blog to play around with  urlLink Blogger's new features .
523-It will return to normal shortly.

0-       Every day should be a half day.
1-Took the afternoon off to hit the dentist, and while I was out I managed to get my oil changed, too.
2-Remember that business with my car dealership this winter?
3-Well, consider this the epilogue.
4-The friendly fellas at the Valvoline Instant Oil Change on Snelling were nice enough to notice that my dipstick was broken, and the metal piece was too far down in its little dipstick tube to pull out.
5-Looks like I'm going to need a magnet.
6-Damn you, Kline Nissan, daaaaaaammmnnn yooouuuu....   Today I let my boss know that I've submitted my Corps application.
7-The news has been greeted by everyone in the company with a level of enthusiasm that really floors me.
8-The back deck has finally been cleared off by the construction company working on the place.
9-This company, for anyone who's interested, consists mainly of one guy who spends his days cursing at his crew of Spanish-speaking laborers.
10-Construction of my deck began around the time Nixon was getting out of office.
11-Consider the ball rolling.
12-I've submitted my application and health review, and I've made myself available for assignment starting March 2005.
13-I'm going to be back in the office environment again starting Thursday.
14-Cry for me.
15-Oh well, I think hitting the submit button on my application tomorrow might actually make that return bearable.
16-I'm still not making any headway with my family.
17-In fact, I think Mom has been rallying the troops (aka aunts and uncles) against me.
18-Meanwhile, my friends have been really supportive of the idea.
19-Thanks, all.
20-It's frustrating, you know?
21-Here, I want to get out into the world, have a pinch of adventure, and maybe help some people out in the process, and I'm earning the resentment of the entire freakin' family because of this.
22-I can only hope that, over time, cooler heads will prevail.
23-There's now a nationwide girlfriend hunt on for yours truly (hell, with Mom's Mexico ties, this shit could go international), because, obviously, the cure for all this foolishness is for me to get laid.
24-Oh, and I should buy myself something nice.
25-Problem solved.
26-Life is so sad.
27-Had a spot of Sunday night insomnia, fueled mostly by my discussions with the parents yesterday.
28-Thankfully, Jack Daniels helped me out with that.
29-Whoever is in charge of late night Sunday programming should be shot.
30-Sunday night insomnia is not an uncommon phenomenon, and TV needs to be there for people in their hour(s) of need!
31-Jerks.
32-Two points for anyone who can identify that bit of dialogue (one of my favorite bits).
33-Hint: Director Steven Soderbergh insists that it's meaningless.
34-Back to  About Schmidt  for a moment.
35-I just love the name Schmidt.
36-Does anyone else feel the same way?
37-So many superfluous letters... that kooky "c"... that silent "d".
38-Along those same lines: it took Michael Moore to really help me memorize the spelling of "Fahrenheit".
39-Yes, I'm still adhering to my own rule that periods don't need to go inside quotation marks.
40-The parents are on their way out.
41-I'm going to try to think of something to cook, lest we end up at Axl's Bonfire Grill down the street.
42-Let me see... corn on the cob fresh from my grimy stove-top, or perhaps a nice walleye salad at Axl's?
43-Decisions, decisions.
44-About Schmidt  this afternoon.
45-Pretty good.
46-A little vexed by the ending.
47-I think I'm getting too lazy to interpret ambiguity.
48-Finished up most of my application today, essay questions and all.
49-All that remains is to inform my references of their reference status... and that could very well mean letting my company know that I'm planning to leave in 6 mos.
50-to a year.
51-I'm not sure how they'll react, but I'm not all that concerned, either.
52-Good people there, certainly, but I am giving them at least  six months  notice.
53-At this point, the only thing that gives me pause is Sydney.
54-I have to make sure she has a home for a few years, and I have to be sure that whoever gets her knows what they're getting into.
55-Sydney's a good cat in a lot of ways... very clean, very well mannered, sweet as all get out... and that tiny meow.
56-That said, she likes to scratch stuff, and I should probably get that in check before I expose her to furniture that isn't dorm-rated.
57-I spent a good hour last night paging through the application and making little notes about what to say for the longer, essay portions.
58-The questions being asked are standard job interview stuff, at least they were at the University.
59-Basically, how do you handle diversity, and why do you want to work here?
60-As for the short answers: I haven't decided whether I should be concerned by the fact that there's an entire page dedicated to previous volunteer experience... and, apart from a pledge that I'm going to be doing some tutoring work for the Minnesota Literacy Council, that page is going to be completely blank.
61-The job history page says to go back "at least 10 years."
62-Ten years ago, I was 16.
63-I was working at Best Buy, and I hated it.
64-I should note, though, that I saw my old manager working at Audio King (back when it was called Audio King), many months ago.
65-Then there was Media Play... then Hollywood Video...
66-I can't believe that an international aid organization would find my ability to upsell Packard Bells, or say in what section  Femalien  resides, remotely interesting.
67-How I spent the remainder of my Thursday night: Watched  The Fog of War , an amazing Errol Morris doc about Robert McNamara.
68-Then, I went to sleep and had strange dreams involving Holly Hunter.
69-It's pretty obvious that I'm not a great learner of lessons, because here I am writing the umpteeth "first blog entry" of my life.
70-Someone, somewhere (probably pretty close to here, actually), is going to open up this domain expecting to see handsome video game Cratchit digging his way out of a sand trap, only to find I'm on the blogging track again.
71-Cue blood squib explosions and the first movement of Carmina Burana.
72-But, wait.
73-I'm a changed man, baby!
74-Things will be different this time, I swear!
75-Well, maybe not right away, but eventually, I hope.
76-I've been feeling more than a little anxious the past few months.
77-Life as a web developer has sort of burned me out, and I think I'd like to try something different... something that will get me closer the Great Life Goal I'm shooting for.
78-I'm not sure what the Goal is exactly, but I get the feeling I'll never get there on my current course.
79-Web development is great and all, but sometimes I get the impression that, in this field, I'm driven more by my perfectionism than by any genuine love of the work.
80-It's no secret to anyone that's spoken to me in the past few months that I'm about this (--) close to joining the Peace Corps.
81-In fact, the application is sitting on my coffee table right now.
82-There's a pen there, too.
83-Oh, and I've filled in a few blanks with that very same pen.
84-There are a few very big blanks that are going to demand more brainpower than I can muster after 8-something hours of mind-numbing development, but I promise you that I'm going to power through and get all 16+ pages of the form in the mail by the end of next week.
85-I'm sure even my fans in Chicago will be able to hear my mother's cries when she hears the news.
86-So, you see, this blog has a reason for existing.
87-I'm hitting the reset button on life, and you're all going to be here to see it.
88-Dramatic, right?
89-Anyway, here we go.
90-My reference forms trickled in last week, and that left the weekend for me to buck up my cross-cultural adaptation essay, something I've been really struggling with.
91-What's a significant experience  you've  had with adapting to a different culture?
92-You'd think that a three month stint in Europe would make a question of this kind really easy to answer, but it doesn't... tourism, as it turns out, doesn't really lend itself to forcing you adapt to anything other than washing your clothes in a sink.
93-I wish I could say I've needed to wipe my butt with a leaf once in my life, but that's just not the case... hence, my application to the PC.
94-Back to the story, then.
95-I filled up the huge PC envelope last night and sent it on its way this morning.
96-There's an education addendum that I decided against filling out, only because it would have been a pretty pathetic-looking effort.
97-My IT addendum, on the other hand, was five pages long.
98-Huzzah!
99-I'd still rather not spend two years sitting in front of a computer in Whateverstan, but I don't want to limit my placement opportunities, either.
100-So that's that.
101-Now I wait for a nomination.
102-On the 'rents:  This weekend, I told them that I've submitted my application and met with a recruiter.
103-Their heads didn't explode.
104-They didn't key my car or light my hair on fire.
105-Still, Dad says that I'm making a mistake, and Mom said she wouldn't be able to sleep.
106-I stressed the importance of optimism, as opposed to--well, you know--flipped-out, irrational fatalism.
107-DNC:  Politics.
108-Feh.
109-Here's my take on politics:   Dear Republicans:  George W. Bush...
110-This is the best you've got?
111-Are you fucking serious?
112-Dear Democrats:  John Kerry...
110-This is the best you've got?
111-Are you fucking serious?
115-That is all.
116-You may return to your regular business.
117-Hey, I gave you guys a little vacation.
118-Hope you enjoyed it.
119-Met with my Peace Corps recruiter Friday afternoon at the PC office above Kieran's.
120-Answered a bunch of those types of questions you get at job interviewsm, and was fingerprinted for my soon-to-be-generated FBI file.
121-There goes my backup plan of becoming a jewel thief.
122-Managed to skirt around conversation relating to this on Sunday, when I visited the parents.
123-Actually, I haven't yet told them that I've actually started the application process, only that I've been thinking seriously about it.
124-I probably would have gotten into it, but Mom called me on Thursday afternoon, loaded up with a bunch of anecdotes from the "Casualties of Peace" series of articles that ran in the Dayton Daily News last year.
125-Arguing with your mother is a good way to ruin your lunch break, and many of the hours thereafter.
126-But I really should be going.
127-Hoping to get the rest of my paperwork in this week.
128-After that, I'll ready myself for a series of invasive medical check-ups.
129-Joy!
130-My parents have the week off work... so when the weekends just aren't enough time to argue about my decisions, now I can do that on Thursday mornings, too!
131-Something about social circles, I guess: my parents insist that everyone they talk to about my future excursion rolls their eyes at the idea, throws their hands up in the air and cries "Why?!"
132-Perhaps they exaggerate.
133-My mother is a veritable encyclopedia of horror stories about international travel.
134-"Didn't you hear about those people in Honduras two years ago that were tortured and killed?"
135-"Didn't you hear about that couple in Mexico that they put in jail and wanted $10,000 from?
136-And the wife had appendicitis.
137-And then Satan bit their arms off, and smuggled them over the border... stuffed with cocaine!"
138-"You don't want to go to Africa!
139-They have apartheid, and they like to kill white people!"
140-[rolls eyes]    
       A recruiter called today, and I'm all set up to interview/be fingerprinted next Friday afternoon.
141-The recruiter also wants to flesh out one of my essay responses.
142-I wasn't altogether happy with my essays.
143-Like I've said before, my capacity for churning out long form answers that are semi-coherent has been damaged by one too many English classes over the years.
144-More often than not, I come off sounding like a damn moron... or maybe I always sounded that way, and all of those English classes just helped me to recognize my own moronitude.
145-Setback: I called today to register for ESL pre-training classes, but it turns out they were completely full for the month.
146-OK.  August, then.
147-Now I won't be able to sit down and actually tutor anyone until sometime in September.
148-Too many do-gooders in this world, I tell you.
149-This weekend: Friday, I did very little.
150-Saturday, I tried to see the Grand Excursion, but the boats were late, and it started to rain.
151-Plus, I didn't care.
152-Jer and I hooked up PSX controllers to the computer and played some old arcade games via MAME.
153-You know MAME, right?
154-Of course you do.
155-Everyone comes back to MAME once a year to remember just how bad most of the games were they drooled over years ago.
156-Remember "Narc" and "Bad Dudes"?
157-Terrible, terrible games ( "I'm bad!"
158-).
159-"Final Fight" still seems decent, and thankfully shows that not  all  of those precious quarters were wasted.
160-Ahh, to be back in the K-mart arcade playing "Altered Beast" and "Time Warriors"...  Sunday, I sat around some more.
161-While everyone else was watching fireworks, I was sitting through "Fahrenheit 9-11".
162-In a nutshell: I loved the first ten minutes, including the minimalist title sequence, and the eerie handling of 9-11.
163-Moore's naked contempt for G.W.
164-is palatable when it's merely being insinuated.
165-It's less so when he refers to G.H.W.
166-Bush as G.W.
167-'s "daddy"... but then I guess that's what political discourse has become in this country.
168-As with "Bowling for Columbine", Moore's film is most effective when read at arm's length.
169-Many of his facts are incorrect, and the things he infers can be completely unfair, but some of the broader strokes (such as our cozy relationship with Saudi Arabia, or the increased fear-mongering of the media in the past few years) invite discussion, which is probably a good thing.
170-Wild man Dan Nordquist has invited me to post on his new  urlLink video game blog .
171-See you there.
172-Got a big pack of PC forms in the mail yesterday, including a few for my fingerprints.
173-With luck, I'll get an interview scheduled this week or next.
174-How are you doing?
175-I'm so happy to hear that!
176-Not feeling terribly motivated to get outside for some fireworks this evening.
177-I've been dead tired all day, to tell you the truth.
178-Spent some time out at my parents' place today, but Peace Corps didn't make the meeting agenda, so the Big News will have to wait a week.
179-Signed up for Google News Alerts about the Peace Corps today, just to keep my eye on things.
180-Bleh, I can't seem to eat anything that agrees with me these past few weeks.
181-I wonder if I have a parasite.
182-I received a short E-mail from the local PC recruiter this morning.
183-They've received my application, so I guess the online form works.
184-More forms on the way.
185-Sent a mail to the MLC last night to get signed up for their programs.
186-ESL tutor pre-training starts next Tuesday.

1314-It was told to the mutant by his friend "Jack".
1315-Jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as "flag worship".
1316-I should mention that my friend Jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.
1317-Jack is a mechanic.
1318-He works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment.
1319-He keeps the machinery running and he likes his job.
1320-Jack is fighting terrorism his way.
1321-A few days before the anniversary of 9/11, Jack was approached by his employer with a nice new American flag.
1322-"Jack, I just bought a flag."
1323-Jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, "I am happy for you.
1324-What does this mean to me?"
1325-"You are the mechanic," says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic.
1326-"Can you build us a flagpole?"
1327-"Yeah, I suppose I could.
1328-But it will take time away from working on our vehicles.
1329-I am not doing this on my own time."
1330-"Of course."
1331-And so, Jack set off to build a flagpole.
1332-Jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer.
1333-He has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company.
1334-But he got on with it anyway.
1335-Jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth.
1336-Based on these figures, Jack produced a flagpole atop the office.
1337-Old Glory fluttered in the breeze.
1338-Sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, Jack puffed with satisfaction on his Marlboro.
1339-But all was not well my friends.
1340-No.
1341-For as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.
1342-In the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, Jack's flagpole was 'half-assed', a first year student's attempt at an art form best left to professionals.
1343-The office dwellers complained to Jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.
1344-"It's not that bad," says Jack.
1345-"No one can see that, it still looks OK."  "It's a brand new flag.
1346-It has to come down until you make the pole higher," says the employer.
1347-"That will cost more money and more time.
1348-An extension will have to be added to the pole.
1349-And I will have to build a new bracket."
1350-"That's fine, do whatever you need to do."
1351-And so Jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof.
1352-Satisfied with his work, Jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.
1353-The flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered Jack's accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.
1354-"Jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?"
1355-"Who is that going to impress?"
1356-says Jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.
1357-"What?"
1358-The sickness affects hearing first.
1359-"We should have lights shine on our flagpole.
1360-Can you do that?"
1361-I'll kill this shit thinks Jack, "Yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work."
1362-"That's OK."  "Is it?
1363-The electrician has to come out of the city.
1364-It will cost more time and more money."
1365-The increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer's brain, "Money is not the issue.
1366-Do whatever you need to do."
1367-Jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set.
1368-In the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof.
1369-A mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers.
1370-The peaceful nastiness of Jack's garage was once again shattered.
1371-Jack's employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager.
1372-By this time, the sickness was in full bloom.
1373-The office worker's need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries.
1374-It was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied.
1375-They needed more.
1376-The office manager confronted Jack, "We want to erect a new flagpole.
1377-How soon can you get it up there?"
1378-"Look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it's going to be a problem.
1379-We will have to weld it.
1380-Our welder will have to weld the poles and we'll have to mount it on the roof very securely.
1381-We are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem.
1382-We need to bail on this deal.
1383-This flag is a bad idea.
1384-It has been nothing but trouble."
1385-The manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred.
1386-They decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot.
1387-And they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.
1388-And so it was that Jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.
1389-An interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday.
1390-This is no problem he thought, I just won't be anywhere dangerous on that day.
1391-But the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at Okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy.
1392-He's done his part for his country.
1393-And now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.
1394-The welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed.
1395-The poles Jack has been using on the roof won't do.
1396-Being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening.
1397-It must then be folded into a triangle.
1398-And what's more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.
1399-Jack thinks this is fine idea.
1400-Jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time.
1401-Indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on.
1402-His brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.
1403-Jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.
1404-The welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits.
1340-No.
1406-They must take the flag to the VFW Hall.
1407-There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on.
1408-Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.
1409-The welder took the flag with him to the VFW Hall, so if you don't get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why.
1410-Sickness takes a toll.
1411-Soon thereafter, Jack is called into an office meeting.
1412-He stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth.
1413-Jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty.
1414-As he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.
1415-"What is this all about?
1416-I'm busy," he grumbles.
1417-"We need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag," says the office manager.
1418-"What flag?"
1419-"This is important.
1420-We need to decide how this will be handled."
1421-"Do I have this right?
1422-I had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?"
1423-The office manager can't take it anymore, "Can I see you in here for a moment?"
1424-They go into a private office.
1425-"Geez Jack, what are you a communist?"
1426-"No.
1427-I am a nazi."
1428-"Oh God, Jack, don't say things like that.
1429-People don't think that kind of talk is funny."
1430-"Ja, I am really."
1431-"Look Jack, it's just a little flag."
1426-"No.
1433-If I have a little flag on a wooden stick," waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, "That is a little flag.
1434-You are holding a meeting for something that does not exist.
1435-I have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight AM tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do."
1436-"I get it, OK.
1437-Go."
1438-And go he did.
1439-The manager returned to the meeting, "I don't know.
1440-I guess he's just un-patriotic..."  Indeed.
1441-I am Jack's complete lack of patriotism.
1442-The sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, "Jack is un-american.
1443-Jack is a communist.
1444-Must be a democrat.
1445-Child abuse, I heard.
1446-A satanist..." They just could not understand it.
1447-Why would anyone hate the flag so much?
1448-Thou shalt have no other god before me.
1449-Unless it's the flag.
1450-Amen.
1451-Jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring Jack back into the fold.
1452-Jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.
1453-"How much money have you spent on this flag deal?"
1454-"Well, the flag was a hundred dollars."
1455-"And you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag."
1456-The boss can't believe this, "It can't be that much."
1457-Sick people can't count.
1458-"Go figure."
1459-He did.
1460-The boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have.
1057-Isn't that special?
1462-Now.
1463-The electrician.
1464-Remember the electrician?
1465-The electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn't there, on the flagpole, that also isn't there.
1466-Jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the VFW Hall.
1467-He also advised him that if these people didn't get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.
1468-The office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go.
1469-Since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable.
1470-He also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag.
1471-Sickness causes laziness.
1472-The electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done.
1473-And in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights.
1474-No doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.
1475-Since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.
1476-Enter the boss's idiot son.
1477-The boss's son has never operated a ditcher.
1478-But since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn.
1479-Are you getting ahead of me yet?
1480-So he's running the ditcher.
1481-Once it starts it's pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary.
1482-Jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.
1483-"The line turns back there," Jack yells over the machine noise, "Don't you need to turn the ditcher now?"
1484-"Yeah, I'm going to turn it over here, in a minute."
1485-Jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it.
1486-Just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise.
1487-Sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.
1488-The power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby.
1489-The phones aren't working either.
1490-No cable tv.
1491-And all eight-hundred feet of the DSL fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher's impeller.
1492-Now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the DSL cannot easily be fixed.
1493-The repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them.
1494-And then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.
1495-Meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the DSL is down, (don't ask me why).
1496-So, no money coming in.
1497-The computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of Jack's computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.
1498-Once the crisis had passed, Jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was.
1499-Jack is funny that way.
1500-"Fuck that flag," the boss said.
1501-It is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.
1502-Three-thousand dollars.
1503-For a flag they didn't have.
1504-On a flagpole they also didn't have.
1505-Is there a point to my story?
1506-Well, fuck if I know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don't you?
1507-We were talking about sickness.
1508-When illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can.
1509-Sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.
1510-The mental illness of "flag worship" is different.
1511-Only a really good beating will get it out of your system.
1512-Well anyway, that's Jack's prescription.
1513----The Happy Ending---  Jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers.
1514-He went through the office passing them out.
1515-"One for you, and one for you..." he sang as he went along.
1516-He reached the office manager with the last one, "And one for you..."  "All right!
1517-I know just where to put it," said the office manager, slapping the American flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor.
1518-"That's great!"
1519-Indeed it was.

3378-urlLink Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012  (PDF) The letter that follows takes us on a darkly imagined excursion into the future.
3379-A military coup has taken place in the United States--the year is 2012--and General Thomas E. T. Brutus, Commander-in-Chief of the Unified Armed Forces of the United States, now occupies the White House as permanent Military Plenipotentiary.
3380-His position has been ratified by a national referendum, though scattered disorders still prevail and arrests for acts of sedition are underway.
3381-A senior retired officer of the Unified Armed Forces, known here simply as Prisoner 222305759, is one of those arrested, having been convicted by court-martial for opposing the coup.
3382-Prior to his execution, he is able to smuggle out of prison a letter to an old War College classmate discussing the "Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012."
3383-In it, he argues that the coup was the outgrowth of trends visible as far back as 1992.
3384-These trends were the massive diversion of military forces to civilian uses, the monolithic unification of the armed forces, and the insularity of the military community.
3385-His letter survives and is here presented verbatim.
3386-It goes without saying (I hope) that the coup scenario above is purely a literary device intended to dramatize my concern over certain contemporary developments affecting the armed forces, and is emphatically not a prediction.

88-That and the fact i don't have one and never used one for extended ammount of time so i can't realize i'd use it as much as my half a dozen Palm Pilots i have laying about.
89-Then i discover apps like,  urlLink WiFiFoFum , which kicks my gadget addiction, specifically the PocketPC vein into high gear.
90-Hopefully the craziness over the iPod Mini will finally subside with news of  urlLink this  coming out.
91-I meant to post this a day or two ago but totally forgot oops.
92-This is the kind of stuff that really pisses me off about big business, specifically the RIAA and MPAA:  urlLink Slashdot | RIAA Loss Report Contradicts Nielsen Sales Record          
            urlLink Women in Gaming  is a great insight into why "gaming for women" fails.
93-As i've been saying for years, if you want to understand why it's failing -- asking women will usually generate the proper response.
94-Unfortunately business and gaming companies usually end up with  urlLink this.
95-Oh and a side note(being a complete chauvinistic pig to boot) the author is amazingly hot, Stevie Case at least, i can't state how Alice looks as there is only a sketch          
           It's projects like  urlLink this origami folding robot , that make me realize, i don't have as much of a head for 3D and robotics as i think i do.
96-It's just amazing stuff, all the different concepts that need to be mastered in order to make such a device.
97-This  urlLink blog entry  is a perfect example of why i blog and why i feel blogging is important.
98-It's not about "stating" something as fact.
99-It's about posting commentary on the world around us and quite often asking for feedback from the community.
100-I know in past blogs i've ran i've asked questions as many times as i've posted pure commentary.
101-I think it's just a new idea in media, and it will take time for people to understand exactly WHY it's different the past forms.
102-I must say, as a gamer and gadget freak, i'm very saddened by the lack of "cool stuff" that America has compared to all the amazingly cool (and mostly useless) stuff Japan has.
103-I mean i can finally get  urlLink a Hello Kitty memory card for the PS2 ,  urlLink Metal Gear Gamecube Bundle Pack .
104-It's all only via import.
105-Come on guys get with it and bring us cool limited editions.
106-Americans are RIPE for the what seems like the Japanese tradition of owning multiple copies of consoles.
107-I mean if they brought that gamecube to the US i'd definitely buy a second one.
108-I'd soo buy a  urlLink FFXI  special edition PS2.
109-Oh well i just have to be patient and vote w/ my money when i can.
110-urlLink Stilettos and Starbucks  Man why didn't i call my blog THAT.
111-I wonder if i could fit this in my new apartment,  urlLink Petabox: a 1,000 terabyte array    i thought i was being hardcore with my dream rack of XServe RAIDs.
112-I just found 2 words that probably could be used to describe me.
113-The first i guess is a good connotation to it.
114-The second seems like it could be used in both good and bad connotations:  urlLink The Word Spy - technosexual   urlLink The Word Spy - geekerati          
           Oh gawd, now we're going to have PC users saying no wonder Macs suck look how slow they run on my emulator.
115-urlLink Mac Rumors: PearPC - PowerPC/Mac OS X Emulation on a PC          
            urlLink Neural.it: English content.
116-Ahh the days of an EMAC student rush through my memory while at this site.
117-Makes me remember why i hated the program and refuse to become an "artist".
118-The new version of playfair,  urlLink hymn -- Hear Your Music aNywhere  which cracks the DRM on tunes purchased from iTunes, but doesn't strip your Unique ID from the file.
119-I feel this is the best anti DRM software yet.
120-DRM is a touchy subject and it's still in the process of finding the "right path".
121-So having tools like this is handy in case said DRM style becomes antiquated.
122-Though in the end you are still breaking the licensing agreement/law.
123-urlLink  Fresh Air: Bill O'Reilly Interview .
124-He doesn't want us to here parts of this interview so of course i need to blog about it and let everyone know to listen to the interview and pass on the fact that he doesn't want people to hear it.
125-Wow the new Blogger is really quite sexy.
126-I must say i didn't think that Blogger could get much better, but this is definitely much better.
127-i need to get  urlLink Anthony Hamilton's  music.
128-His music has a real nice sound.
129-To bad i can't find the link i've used to make iTMS links.
130-Oh well, you will know how to find the album i'm sure.
131-EDIT: Oops forgot  urlLink Los Lonely Boys   EDIT: Oops forgot to publish haha but as you can see i re-found the link to format iTMS links again.
132-Much like cars, some people just shouldn't be allowed to use computers.
133-Continuing in my pirate radio vein:  urlLink iPod pirate radio bumper stickers .
134-Not sure how much the FCC would like these but eh, stick it to the man.
135-Sorry that was horrible but i couldn't help it.
136-So it looks like my post yesterday about needing being able to make a pocket size radio station has been answered with a  urlLink DIY iTrip Amplifier .
137-I mean yea we could just broadcast with an iTrip but that's only like 20-30 feet if lucky.
138-So this is a welcome addition to the collection.
139-urlLink How-To Tuesday: Make your own Pirate Radio Station with an iPod  Reminds me of my frosh year at RPI when we made a pirate radio stationg that blanketed freshman hill.
140-The fact there is a possibility to make a pocket size pirate radio station is awesome.
141-I'm very much for low power pirate radio stations, ahh the good ol' days.
142-I don't want one, I NEED  urlLink one .
143-No seriously, please i'm a sucker for old school film tech.
144-I have an old school 8MM and i'd have probably half a dozen or more if i still went to yard sales and flea markets like i used to when i was a kid.
145-The fact i can actually have the look and feel of old film tech and digital internals just makes me more excited then is reasonably expected.
146-Ok this is quite old but supposedly people have  urlLink the real dirt on Apples Cinema Displays?
147-While the sizes seem about right as well as the resolutions there are a couple of things that common sense just state don't work.
148-First of all, switching from the ADC(Apple Display Connector) to DVI.
149-I think Apple really likes be slick and having as few wires as possible.
150-With dropping ADC you lose Video, Power and USB all in one cable.
151-So you would go from 1 cable to 3 cables.
152-Which brings me to my next point, they state there will be 2 firewire ports on it.
153-How is this possible since ADC doesn't carry firewire signal and if they do go with DVI there would be neither USB or Firewire.
154-So now that's 4 wires coming out of this display.
155-Bleh i wouldn't mind many of these features but just don't see it happening.
156-Sadly right before my switch over, i as well suffered from the delussion that I could  urlLink turn my PC into a Mac .
157-As the expression goes the interface is just skin deep.
158-You don't get the true OS X experience.
159-Well perhaps you can now, as when i did this it was 3 years ago, and the software on the market to do these things was new and buggy.
160-Still interesting to see, i wonder what the psychological aspects of all this are.
161-Perhaps there aren't any haha.
162-I have dreams about having an army of robotic artist minions to do my bidding as an artist.
163-For i seem to think on a more conceptual level and not really good at that whole "creating" bit.
164-I can think of cool idea but horrible at making content.
165-Just all about remixing and re-manifesting previous art into my new pieces and now i almost can have my dream with,  urlLink Project K .
166-So just need more machines making abstract automatic art, preferably which changes over time so that i can incorporate them into my video.
167-Mmmmm robotic artists...
168-It's days like today that i'm still amazed by Apple Computers.
169-There is all this press about a few pictures of a "new"/"upgraded" g5 that have been leaked, or photoshoped.
170-Whatever the case may be.
171-Then they release the  urlLink AirPort Express .
172-I think several times more amazing then an upgraded G5 will ever be.
173-I mean i'm looking forward to a bump since i'm in the market for a  urlLink mid range g5  and  urlLink mid range screen .
174-The fact that they made a complete base station alittle larger then there current powerbricks AND added  urlLink features  to it, just blows me away.
175-Keep it up Apple and keep me amazed.
176-So it looks like the web-utility i use to make the beautiful  urlLink Amazon Links  is offline, hopefully it will be back up soon, but just for record i'm now read  urlLink Angels  Demons  and still playing Rainbow Six, though i did pick up  urlLink Full Spectrum Warrior  i haven't had much free time to play it.
177-Oh by the way, show you how busy i was yestarday.
178-I TOTALLY missed my favorite  urlLink OSes  b-day.
179-Yestarday marked  urlLink Ten Years of BeOS (coverage via slashdot).
180-So i was just thinking about sharing tunes via  urlLink rendezvous and wireless networks .
181-When i realized well i only carry my tunes via my iPod making it useless in this system, then i was like why can't i hook it up to the USB port on the Pocket PC.
182-Nope, USB is a Master/Slave relationship not Peer-to-Peer like Firewire.
183-Luckily  urlLink a USB host Compact Flash card  is soon to be released.
184-Then i realized between USB 1.1 speed, the speed of wireless, and PocketPC speed, this would be gawd awful slow, i still think it would be worthwhile to tinker around with.
185-I guess i'll still look forward to a company to actually incorporate this sort of sharing into the Mp3 Player of choice for me.
186-Thank you,  urlLink Engadget  for making my day with this choice quote: "Most people still have absolutely no idea what in the hell were talking about when we bring up Voice over IP (which is why weve long since abandoned it as a pickup line)."
187-It's the simple things in life right?
188-Ahhh one of my ultimate favorite trends of the 80's(and continuing on i may add) was the breakdance trend.
189-I could watch hours and hours of this stuff.
190-Luckily there appears to be  urlLink Renaissance of Breakin' .
191-Obligitory  urlLink Hello Kitty Robot  Post.
192-Just following tradition.
193-;-).
191-Obligitory  urlLink Hello Kitty Robot  Post.
192-Just following tradition.
193-;-).
197-Some really beautifully designed audio hardware being  urlLink Bootlegged into digital Objects          
           This set of designer  urlLink Radiators , is to be filed under "tobuy when I'm a millionaire" category @  urlLink del.icio.us .
198-Hhmmm perhaps i should get these,  urlLink notvanilla braille t-shirts and wearable art; provocative, touchable and interactive , for Cass to wear.
199-To bad about the flip out description.
200-To make up for my lack of posts, here is a really cool, different PDA in fact it's not calling itself a PDA.
201-It has dubbed itself the TDA(Tactile Digital Assistant.)
202-Without further ado their web site:  urlLink Welcome to the Jackito-TDA community website          
           Ok so I'm finally getting settled into my new place which means two things: Me blogging again and a gallery of pics of my new place woohoo.
203-Though i'll probably post rough pics of what it looks like with what little stuff i have in my apartment then a "finalized" version in about a month when i get the last of my furniture ordered and arrived.
204-Moving into my first apartment alone you realize how many "holes" you have in personal possessions as roommates seem to offset the need for owning everything.
205-But i'm excited as i get to order my sofa and bed this week.
206-Left to get: 2 Desks and Dining Room chairs.
207-This is a pretty boring post but just an update why i haven't posted anything in SOOO long.
208-Oh and happy 4th of july by the way.
209-I need more time in the day where i can just sit and blog all the crap that i come in contact with.
210-Hopefully when my job application for Millionaire goes through that will be a side job i can pick up.
211-Ok i haven't posted in a while.
212-I haven't fled the country or locked up or anything bad, just settling into my new apartment and working hard.
213-So no time to dork out, plus no really comfy spots in my house yet as i don't have a real bed or couches yet, to dork out in.
214-So not to worry i'll be back soon.
215-I sooo need one of  urlLink THESE  it's not even funny and it's only $229 to boot.
216-Not to mention it comes with Toast 6 Titanium which is a $99 in and of itself!!
217-Ahh i need more money.
218-Wonder if Apple will make the leap and make dual layer media.
219-Here's to hoping.0-01,August,2004

0-             testing         
             with each and every passing day its hard to imagine your going away... i still wake up every day cherishing your presence in a special way... no matter where i am or what i'm doing your always there in my heart... you never leave my mind, or eyes, i don't even try it would be to hard....  each minute away seems like a whole day and a different place.... each hour is spent picturing your smile and your face.... each thought becomes physical, as i race to make it home.... excited to just see your face, not have to talk on the phone....  i realize when i walk through the door i've been dreaming all day.... your more beautiful than i could ever dream now that we're face to face... as i wrap my arms around you and cherish we're in the same place... alls i can think of is your passionate kiss, and how i've longed for its taste....  its time to relax now so we sit down and vent about our days... we talk about all we've done, and how we missed each others face.... we spend our evenings together whoever said they needed space.... we wrap around each other as we drift away to our dreams... i'm laying next to the only girl i want how bad can life be.....  to many this is boring and just seems like killing time.... to me this is heaven and just being with what is mine.... listening to her breathe in my ear, knowing just then shes fine.... we might be lame laying there all curled.... but i wouldn't change a thing, i'm the happiest man in the world....         
             today was cool.
1-i woke up this morning @ 9:30 and got dressed, just then i decided that salleh looked cold so i laid back in bed with her to keep her warm for a few more minutes... fast forward to 12:30... i woke up a second time... undressed took a shower .... then as i was leaving sally muttered... "what about mcdonalds" with her sleepy voice still sleeping in bed... she wanted some breakfast or lunch .... so i left here and went and got us some grub when  i got back we ate together and i left for work.
2-she stayed home and then at 4 went to work.... blah thats done now.
3-i went to work then went to my boy kewons house and hooked up a computer.... saw his pitbulls ... after all of that i drove home and on the way sally called me and wanted me to come up there and see her... so i did.
4-i had the smoke house chicken dinner... after i ate that i went and smoked a cigerette with her in the backroom where she said to me, "if i get caught i'm getting fired.." heh see what she will do for a cigerette with me?
5-hahah i'd like to think it was because i was there but i just think she needed a cigerette... :P  anywho now i'm home .... and i went out and bought 8 things of red bull and a 5th of vodka... and her and i are going to drink and play match.... for the first time in a minute her and i are going to have our alone night and i'm like so looking forward to it.... a night where her and i can make each other laugh and giggle... then by the end of the night with all of those intoxicants inside of us we will be going to bed... or at least trying.... so this defintly could be a good night from what i see so far... i'm totally excited.... okay here she is.... haha complaining about my pop she carried in getting on her shirt.... UNTIL NEXT TIME.... PEACE         
             so far today has been quite interesting.
6-i arrived at work to find that one of my loans was ready to be processed and closed, which means lots of money coming my way real quick.
7-then i got paid for another deal, sally came down to my office and we went to the bank together to deposit the check into our account.
8-she just now left to work from here and is working the majority of the evening most likely.
9-i think i'm gonna head home here in a bit, possibly go tanning on the way back... hmmmm ya know fuck it... i think i'm gonna have 'steve time' and go ahead and do that shit.
10-things have been really ..... stressful lately i'm not sure why but.... in the words of eminem... sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders everyones leaning on me.....  i'm gonna pull through and be victorious though... i mean fuck, i don't have a choice.
11-i have people that are depending on me... so i have too.
12-sometimes life just seems like it would be so much easier with out any obligations except for myself, but then i realize that easier is not always better... and sometimes when you have obligations they make you achieve more.... i wouldn't trade my obligations for nothing.
13-my obligations are human and alive... and i love em both... but fuck... heh.... (peanut  salleh).
14-well fuck i better get out of here and get to the tanning salon before traffic gets crazy... so i'm on my way out.... peace!
15-[ private entry ]         
             i feel like shit.
16-blah.
17-don't you hate when your back is against the wall... and you really can't just ... BE FREEEEEEE for whatever reasons you have no choice but to be the way you are being.... quiet... secluded..... i don't know... it's just that i know people too well... and i can take hints even when they are not hints... its just someone talking.... but inadvertantly giving hints.... hints to me... what they really want... and thats.... not me there..... blah.
18-*yawn* i apologize for the lack of updates, but you must excuse me for the procrastination.
19-things have been so fucking hectic as of lately it is almost even hard to imagine.
20-i've been going through some things that i'm finally coming to terms with and being able to accept and make the best of it, the last thing that has been on my mind is this website unfortunately.
21-but things are starting to look better (dare i say it?
22-), so hopefully i can continue my habit that i once had and keep posting here... i wish i could just vent and let you guys know what's been going on .... but its   private  .
23-trust me... i would tell you if i thought there was a way.
24-sally and i are great - i'm sure that is what you guys are immediately thinking .... no we are not broken up... she still lives here.... we are still together... and most importantly we are still happy :)  i guess my problems have just been **my** problems.... having a lot of "reality checks" and realizing i'm not where i want to be in life with this mortgage business - so i'm in the process now of trying to do something to change it... so that my work can accommodate my lifestyle that i will be having here shortly when i start school........  basically the world has just been stressful and the last thought on my head has been this site ;)  hope to be posting more now...         
              "We don't live in the world of reality, we live in the world of how we perceive reality."
25-Bryan Singer, director of "The Usual Suspects"   today was interesting.
26-i really don't know what too say about it... i woke up feeling good considering what i did to my body the night before with drinking, sally on the other hand hardly could pull herself out of the bed.
27-anywho the majority of the day i spent laying on the couch with sally pretty much telling one another our hopes dreams and regret for drinking as much the night before.
28-so fuck i'm feeling wierd.
29-*sigh* i don't even know where to start.
30-what happens when you cherish something so special, and it is only special because of something unique... i mean that is what makes it ... "special".
31-so what happens when you begin to see that vision of the unique quality in that special person changing beyond your control.
32-the person has several different qualities which make them so special, but this one quality almost defies the person to your heart.
33-possibly a quality that opens the door to your heart.
34-blah blah blah... i don't know where i'm going with this... or if i even wanna go on with this.... but none the less ....  it boils down to the fact, that no matter what i'm feeling or why i'm feeling it.... even if it makes sense to me... i can't react to it based on selfish reasons.....  but sometimes.... i just want to feel like... i'm worth a piece of sacrafice... because ... to me.... my special person is worth the ultimate sacrafice.. and if i would lay that down with out ever questioning a thing or think of being selfish... for something so little, why can't i feel that way?
35-its selfish in its self... and blah .... blah .... blah.
36-i'm going now...            
             its saturday night sally and i are getting ready to go over shawns house and drink play pool and more less get intoxicated again.
37-(begining to feel like an alchoholic).
38-none the less, last night we went down too ypsi and partied with sallys sister stephy... hmmm it was a really good time we ended up going to her frat friends party house and getting pretty drunk.... heh then when we woke up this morning (stayed the night out there) - and after the fact we decided that we would go to my buddy kewons house and look at his pit puppy that he wants to sell me... it is beautiful - then he offered to sell me a condo that he owns.... blah... heh been an interesting day.....  so yeah i think i'm gonna get going now... btw we posted the pictures of florida... just haven't added them to the pictures page.... heh go check them out right here....  urlLink florida pictures          
             another day in the life of steve... last night i went and saw the movie "passion of christ".... what a powerful movie, didn't expect that whatsoever.
39-everyone i have talked to that has seen the movie has said that they cried during the movie, well leaving the movie i was kind of scared not knowing why i didn't cry... i mean i teared up on armagaddon... and not passion of the christ?
40-am i the devil?
41-nah heh it was the late show we went too and the mood that was overcasting the night.
42-none the less sally and i enjoyed the hell out of the movie.
43-today i'm going to the gym after work (where i am right now) while sally i think is going to get her nails done.
44-thats about all that is going on right now.... so until something fun changes..... or something... or anything.... um.... peace.
45-dear monday, i hate you.
46-i always have.
47-but i need you, and never have.
48-it's monday and here we are again, a new week that no one wants to experince.
49-i'm at work, after tearing myself apart from sally this morning who only wanted me to be there with her and not leave.... she sat by the window as i was leaving and made me feel bad.. it was cute - but then i had to convince her that we need money and i don't make money by watching her put on make up... i wish i did... well who doesn't.
50-so now i'm at work and i'm still waiting on my mom to get some paper work to me....   this weekend sally and i just chilled, begining with friday night it was an early night - we both fell alsleep rather early ..... she worked all night.
51-saturday night we got really intoxicated and i really can't recall much of saturday night because that is how drunk we were.
52-sunday we laid together on the couch and watched a documentary on tupac and biggie, then fell alsleep watching the oscars.
53-haha anywhoooooo.
54-last night i decided that i'm going to start a new corporation.
55-like an online mortgage loan officer.
56-it is still in the works of being planned and cordinated, but hopefully in the next few weeks i'm able to compile enough resources and information in order to get this put together.
57-this could only make me more money, by providing a central location where people can go and fill out an online loan application, recieve a user name and password, so that they are able to login at any time and check the status of the pending loan application - additionally any time a change happens with their loan application the system will email them and make the client aware of the changes.
58-i am learning that advertising is such a complicated, yet simple task.
59-to advertise you are gambling.
60-you are putting a lot of assets into the marketing campaign with only hope and faith that there will be a profitable return from it.
61-*sigh*.
62-i hope that this works out for me...i guess you guys will be able to come along my journey in starting this and getting it off the ground..... oh yea and if you have any hints or advice.. you can share that too.... peace.
63-as i pondered what today had to offer me i realized that i'm not even 100% positive as to what this day they call "Memorial Day" signifies.. so I did some research.
64-now today is a very very important day for many families in america, who have been unable to smell, speak, hear, touch, their loved ones due to loosing them in a war and as a former soldier myself i suppose that if i were to have ever died in combat that i would want to be remembered on more than one occasion a year (my birthday).
65-its sad really, as you drive up and down the streets, turn on your radio, this holiday has become more recognized for a "4 day party" than its intended meaning.
66-am i guilty?
67-of course i'm guilty i attempted to party all weekend myself, but now as i sit here and reflect on things and try to remain perceptive into other peoples memorial day weekends, it almost saddens me to think of the family that has lost a love one in a war whether decades ago, or recently.
68-as they drive down the streets they see the weekend slumber and every one smiling having a great time enjoying their 4 day weekend - only wishing that they too could be doing the same thing sharing this weekend with the love one they lost.
69-as they turn on their radio to take away this haunting, disturbing, creepy feeling they are consumed with club and party promotions by the radio stations who are taking this weekend and its purpose and converting it into some sort of lucrative toss up to make some money as they promote a club.
70-i'm lucky, that i'm able to celebrate this weekend and not have to reflect back on any one in particular that i've lost - but how unfortunate for those who do not share that same luck.
71-we raise our flags, start the grill, crack a beer and our weekend has started, the celebration, has started.
72-we as a society have lost sight of the meaning of this weekend, and i just hope that one day possibly next year i can make my own first step towards actually making it... a memorial day...and reserving my celebration for the day that truly is intended for it, independence day.
73-cool quote i found:  " Soldier, rest!
74-Thy warfare o'er, Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking, Dream of battled fields no more.
75-Days of danger, nights of waking. "
76-~Sir Walter Scott   quote found @  urlLink memorial day memorial..   - goodnight.
77-well it's been official... but today is the first official day i felt it.
78-i feel renewed.
79-the last several days have been some of the hardest days of my life...they've been hard.
80-but you know there are so many positive things that this new era in my life brings - and i'm just happy that this weekend a complete stranger was able to make all of these ill feelings go away.
81-it was almost like an angel from heaven sent down to serve the purpose of placing me back into reality and providing me with a positive outlook on things so that i'm able to cope, survive and pick back up.
82-just what i'm doing.
83-here is a random note: i smell her hair where ever i go.... i smell her skin where ever i go... sometimes the scent is so strong... i turn around and look for her....  so back to this weekend.
84-this complete stranger gave me strength, gave me so much in fact that i'm... dare i say ... eager to begin this new era?
85-heh.
86-i am going to try to keep this journal focused on me and my life... my feelings... and i suppose as the days pass so will the times i mention her name...its a bit harder for me than her... i guess she is.... stronger?
87-*wink* .... anyways.. okay that's my post... goodnight :)  and stranger... i know your reading this... so .... thank you again :)  - goodnight everyone and hope you had a good weekend :)  will post about mine ... tomorrow.
88-...and the words came from her mouth.
89-"I can't do this anymore".
90-It's 11:21 pm and i've been in constant battle with this idea all night trying to encourage her to re-think it, and come up with some other solutions that seem a tad more practical and real.
91-after the perfect day we had this just seems that there was not enough thought put into it - i don't know.. i haven't even begun dealing with it yet because it hasn't sit well in my stomach yet... its something rather new that i seem to be numb too at this point - but all hell will break loose when it becomes my reality and i'm forced to have to deal with it... this is something i dont want to have to deal with.. i wasn't ready... is it really that hard for two people to be in love?
92-fuck.
93-i would have never wished for any of this in a million years, the thought of it alone is repulsive.
94-yet in the same reality this has been such a positive boost for you and i - everything between us is seemingly improving, from our ambition too our love, to our sex life.
95-everything just is amazing right now yet pitiful at the same time.
96-i would love to go back to how we were doing simple things, living with one another and spending every waking hour with one another - yet would the "spark" die if such a thing were to ever happen again?
97-do we get along better when we dont live with one another?
98-i don't know... *sigh*.
99-i'm realizing ... we are realizing so many things with this distance between us now - things i think we needed to realize... i just wish they were things that could have been realized while we were living with one another.
100-who knows what the future holds for you and i - but one thing is for certain.. from the sound of it your not going anywhere - you love me to death and nothing is going to come inbetween that - nothing.
101-that would be "shallow" i believe was the word you used for it.
102-*(sigh)*   tonight we watched the american idol finale and it was just amazing, could things have been more relaxing for you and i?
103-its pitiful i was so captivated by the moment of you and i laying together / sitting together / sitting on top of one another that i could hardly focus on the tv to watch the show.
104-then the songs that they were singing were just so ironic to the situation that you and i are facing right now... tonight was just so sureal.
105--goodnight         
             i'm tired of being confused its worse then being abused sometimes i feel like my mind is being used and other times i question the truth and its all because of you yet you too remain confused every day i feel like i'm a bomb about to explode and your my fuse but its not because you choose its because your family holds your hand and likes to emotionally abuse you into making choices its like making noises that ammuse you but after awhile they start to bruise you i wont let them win i wont loose you.
106-i hate the fact i'm always being attacked yet i cant defend myself like i want i want to go crazy like i'm on crack they wont cut you any slack they always watch your back never let you choose for yourself i need some prozac they need to relax they need to stop cutting you down like a tree they need to drop their axe this reality of love not an act the more they keep fighting the more this will turn to another iraq i'll declare war because i have nothing to loose except you and i want you more no matter how many walls they build i'll walk through them and build a door our love will soar their my sore their germs on the floor heres some bleach burn like smores you'll soon learn i'm not going away any time soon i'll make this a chore.
107-you cant buy me or make me leave you cant beg me or force me i'm deaf to the word please i'm forever in your life let go now or your gonna be miserable when shes my wife because i'm not going anywhere i'm running wild like a crackhead with a knife cutting anything that gets in the way of my dream and my sight she is worth the fight in my darkest hour shes my light i'll never let go i'll hold on real tight i wont loosen my grip not even a might because im here for good im done being polite im done being nice im here for the win not your advice so kiss my ass and dream of our wedding each night we just want to be free and romantic nothing can stop us not even your finances...   okay im confused as fuck..  -goodnight         
             each day wait let me rephrase each passing hour seems to be its own struggle.
108-i'm not sure how i am going to deal with another 26 more days but one thing is for certain - i am gonna deal with it.
109-there is no way i'm going to let anything happen in the next 26 days that would make this separation any longer than a month.
110-the only thing i can seem to do is better myself each and every day... i find myself waking up wondering what i can do to make myself better or make sally proud of me.
111-im sick of sitting on the couch bitching about my problems and now that my problems can not get any worse with the reality of my passion, motivation, and other half not living with me and hardly being present in my life but by a mere single instant message every couple of days i'm making changes so at the end of the month things just seem more comfortable and stable.
112-love is crazy eh?
113-i'm just having to deal with the back lash of it in all honesty... dare i say i needed this?
114-well no i don't think i did... i know what i'm doing with my life right now is all that i've wanted to do for several months i just never could find the time or motivation with always just wanting to be with sally doing whatever made her happy... with her absence i'm just able to find the time to accomplish all of these important tasks.
115-this month is working for her i'm sure - almost positive the relationship with her parents that she is trying to establish is being established.. and i'm sure they are giving her all the support that she needs to ensure that the goals she is setting out to complete in this month are completed.
116-i guess in essence we're both doing the same things yet our worlds can not be compared.
117-college.
118-i wish that i was able to live a simple life - where my parents would take care of the majority of my bills and the only thing i was responsible for was basically to perform well in school.
119-live with sally and go to school and leave the finances to mom and dad.
120-that would be outstanding... it would actually be perfect... but then on the flipside of that if that were to ever happen... i would loose the one thing that i value most in my life and thats the freedom to do what i want and make all my decisions without having to discuss them with anyone.
121-i guess the whole, "no strings attached" approach has its ups and its downs... i just don't know.
122-*sigh*    i'm just struggling with the gravity of reality that i'm totally on my own in this world.. and the only thing fairy tale about my life is sally.. she is too good to be true ... and right now... this minute... this hour.. this day.. this week... she  is ... to good to be true.
123-god i miss her.
124-- goodnight.
125-urlLink            
             in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?
126-well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.
127-in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.
128-in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn't.
129-now i'm having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.
130-i'm having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.
131-now i'm living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.
132-okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault.
133-then on top of that i'm having to deal with this new..."rule".
134-you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month "off of me" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).
135-In a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be "her choice" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.
136-so i mean her decision can't shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?
137-well i'm still not feeling "settled" with all of it.
138-Something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say "okay we don't mind this now, you took a month off of him" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don't know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i'm even more at loss... really... blah i just don't know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we'll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i'm counting...   keep ya updated.
139-latah.
140-im a pretty cool guy with a whole lot too hide but its hard to get it out cause i got a whole lota pride thats the defense that attacks you when you try to peep my mind im not an apple pie i sin all the time whether i'm innocent or guilty of a crime my mind is on constant rewind my heart spews nasty slime through my mind turning it to words that rhyme or just a ball face lie never bad intentions just dont like to see you cry and its easier to lie and hide inside then to hang the laundry out to dry then i defeat my own purpose and make you cry and cant even answer the question of why this wont go away not in any near time the only thing i can do is figure out my mind before i disappear as if you went blind.. im my worst enemy but my war is with time..making a switch in my life to turn the sirens into chimes start focusing on dollars and not pinching the dimes everyone can hate me while i take this time but dont forget one thing remains mine.
141-today was a pretty simple day.
142-went to pick up  jessica a new friend of mine at her house way out in the ghetto right off of 8 mile.
143-well she don't live in the ghetto but you have to pass through it to get to where she does live.
144-anywho picked her up... got lost on the way home but i finally got back on track and found the park i was looking for.. we went to the park for a little while and let capone right wild, that was fun, he enjoyed it - we just walked and talked... that was kind of peaceful.
145-we ended up watching dave chapelles hbo special, she had never seen it - so that was a lot of fun we did ALOT of laughing.
146-after that we were about to leave, and mike came up with some weed.
147-its funny how when you least expect it someone pulls weed out of no where isn't it?
148-so we smoked - then i drove her home... and got home a little bit ago from that journey.
149-thats all my day really consisted of, and all it will consist of, because now i'm going to bed - because i'm fucking tired.
150-here is a picture i took today of capone  and jess  - cute.
151-awwww capone and i have a  new friend we like to hang out with :)   here is a picture of her and i watching dave chappelles hbo special...      shes good people.
152--goodnight         
              i saw the feeling close to my eye coming out from where it use to hide if i said i wasn't enjoying it that'd be a lie the question is who are you and why?
153-i only expected a brief encounter and a good friend never thought that i would have deeper desires for you that i now write down with my pen but here it comes there you are and here i go again.
154-captivated by your mind, held back by your eyes, embraced by our time, i'm not going to fight this or hold back i'm going to let it shine.
155-so i went to see 'fahrenheit 911'.
156-it's very impressive, and i certainly recommend that everyone go see it.
157-some of it(oregon state police, etc)seems a bit unnecessary, but the vital and necessary stuff is profoundly vital and necessary.
158-the part of the film that details the involvement between the bush family and the bin laden's and the saudi's is so disturbing that it makes my head ache.
159-some VERY well documented and supported facts: 1-when george bush started his first oil company one of his biggest investors was the bin-laden family(yes, osama bin laden's family).
160-2-the bush family has received over $1.4 billion dollars from the saudi's and from the bin-laden family.
161-3-the saudi ambassador to the u.s is an 'unofficial' member of the bush family, and was invited to dinner at the white house on september 13th, 2001.
162-4-on september 13th over 50 members of the bin-laden family and citizens of saudi arabia were allowed to leave the united states without being questioned by the fbi, even though air traffic was shut down in the united states.
163-5-on september 11th, 2001 george bush senior and other members of the carlyle group(including members of the bin laden family and citizens of saudi arabia)watched on television as the twin towers were attacked by hijacked planes.
164-6-almost all references to saudi involvement in 9-11 have been blacked out by the bush administration.
165-go see this movie, and if you doubt what i say then do a little research and you'll quickly realize that we have suffered through an administration(bush's)that is profoundly corrupt in ways that we never could have even imagined.
166-bush, cheney, halliburton, enron, the bin-laden's, the house of saud, and the hundreds of billions of dollars made from oil(iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)are why we went to war.
167-there were no wmd's in iraq, there were no nascent nuclear programs in iraq, there was no al qaeda presence in iraq.
168-the sad and tragic truth is that we went to war in iraq for oil profits.
169-that's it, and now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt.
170-and it's utterly disgusting.
171-urlLink click here for showtimes and listings.
172--goodnight          
             Nicole, Your comment gave me goosebumps.
173-Your words were so appreciated.
174-Thanks so much!!
175-Steve.. You are such an amazing person.
176-You inspire me with your perseverance  strength.
177-You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I've told you that since the day I met you.
178-You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up.
179-You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves.
180-I've never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life.
181-Your such a doll and I'm sorry for all that you've went through, I'm glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you.
182-Your amazing.
183-Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :)   *taken from the "thursday" post*           
             i miss the smell of your hair i miss the feeling of your care i miss the touch of your lips i miss the feel of your hips i miss the planning trips  i miss talking all night i miss holding you tight i miss telling you its alright i miss holding your hand i miss bitching about traffic jams  i miss the good mornings i miss the good nights i miss the good times i miss the good fights i miss telling you to turn off the light  i miss taking showers together i miss the plans of us being forever i miss the dreams that we had i miss wanting those to happen so bad i miss the feeling of wanting you back.
184-i miss the wanting to give you a hug i miss the comfort of being in love i miss the desire to want to fuck i miss the hurt of seeing you packing i miss the thought of you being attractive  i miss all these things and so much more but i would never allow you back in or even close to the door.
185-there is nothing to miss nothing at all i wish it would have happened faster but then it wouldn't have been such a   beautiful disaster  .
186-well after two days of being completely intoxicated its good to have a day that i'm able to come to my senses and relax.
187-i honestly haven't done anything today, and do not have any plans to do anything.
188-i've sat on my ass the majority of the night watching the entire season 1 of dave chapelle on dvd.
189-i got moved out of my parents house today - the only thing i have left there now is mah dog which i pick up in the morning, i didn't want to bring him over here and let him get in the way and shit soooo he is still at mom and dads with his brother sam.
190-ha!
191-he loves it there its great.
192-anywho... so i got the majority of my stuff out of there and just been sittin down most the evening - @ around 9 my friend sarah came over and watched a few episodes with me - she has to work tomorrow @ 7 so she took off about 20 minutes ago.. so that was kind of cool.
193-so now mike and i are just kind of finishing up the dvd, and then i'm probably going to go in the bedroom and crash and burn because the past two nights have just killed me.
194-i haven't had as much fun as i've had in the past three weeks in the past year.
195-its been a fucking riot.
196-oh yeah... and i finally cut the last bit of communication i had with .... her....  i finally blocked her .
197-God life is going way to good right now...
198-I FUCKING LOVE IT.
199-I've added a link on the right hand side of the page there that links to where i will be posting new pictures and what not.
200-so enjoy that link :P there are already pictures from tuesday and wends night.
201-enjoy it.
202--cheers to the good life.
92-fuck.
204-i'm drunk.
205-so here are the pictures from tonight.
206-enjoy.
207-pictures:  urlLink Pictures from Jd's   -goodfuckingnight         
             i removed the pictures that were here - because there is a link to the right or in the post above :)  -peace :)         
             i sat in a star bucks parking lot allowing the love of my life to enter my heart only for exactly one year later it to be empty and cold... yet as empty and cold as it is... it still beats... and still holds an empty spot that needs to be filled...to say i will not love again... is kind of like saying i'll never smile again... then one day someone just comes by... and takes you by suprise.
208-i got so many things accomplished today i was quite impressed with myself.
209-i ended the day at mikes house, where we spent a few hours over there just bullshitting - then we went over our boy nicks house had a beer or two ... played some darts... i went to arbys because i was FUCKING hungry.
210-i'm home and its 11:20 - i've got an early day tomorrow - one that i'm not looking to forward too, but i am that pay check.
211-christ i like making my own money and it being all mine what a fucking difference in life style... i'm learning how to be selfish all over again... possibly by the end of the week i just might be a selfish person who knows?
212-heh nah i'm just kidding... there is nothing i could buy myself that would give me more happiness then it does when i buy for....or use to buy for... ahhh shit it doesnt matter.
213-so far this is my week thats been planned:  ~ wends - JD's ~ fri - Big Secret Party that I know nothing about but i'm really excited for it... ?
214-~ sat - Recover from the party....  sounds fun eh?
215-okay i'm off to bed to catch some shut eye so that i'm able to function tomorrow....  -goodnight          
             second post of the day.... but i just found two cool things i felt the need to share.
216-as i was sitting bored looking for something to do / or something to read i came across a website that a girl made devoted to her boyfriend.
217-it sort of reminded me of the old envyme.org - yet this had a rich taste about it.
218-somewhere on the site i found a simple writing she had wrote about him, and it choked the shit out of me.
219-so i'm sharing it.
220-My love.
221-My one true love.
222-I wake up for this everyday.
223-I breathe for this.
224-I'm happy because of him.
225-The smell of his hair.
226-His family.
227-His cats.
228-His sense of humor.
229-His eyes.
230-His sweet attitude.
231-His hands.
232-His "uh- huh"s and free back rubs.
233-Everything about him.
234-I love it all.
235-He completes me  theres nowhere else I'd rather be then in his arms, with the title "girlfriend".
236-I'm glad were not arguing.
237-I'm glad were happy.
238-I'm glad we have eachother to talk to.
239-I'M JUST HAPPY.
240-IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.
241-now if you notice there was not a lot of creativity put into this, there was not a lot of fancy words, or an effort to rhyme, this was... i'm going to sit down... and just write how i feel.
242-amazing.
243-the second thing   i want to share - i've heard plenty of times but one of my readers sent it to me, and after the past few weeks - for the first time in my life... i can honestly say... it fits...     don't cry because its over, smile because it happened....    this only fits because i have no regrets with sal, in fact i'm happy it happened.
244-i learned a lot about life, relationships, myself, fuck what didn't i learn?
245-because of my relationship with sally my next relationship is bound to be  fucking amazing  - because of what i learned in this one.
246-so after much partying this weekend - i think i got it all out of my system.
247-this weekend was probably the best weekend i've had since all the drama - only because i didn't really think about it other than recieving a bunch of mail with her name on it - so it just... was an overall smooth weekend.
248-today is sunday, fathers day.
249-i'm not going to go over to my parents and celebrate fathers day today though ... i think i'm going to celebrate... "SONday" because in reality thats all today really is right?
250-haha.
251-anywho so i can't say i'm really 'enjoying' the single life - i miss every bit of my old life... but for the circumstances that i'm faced with i guess i'm making the best of it.
252-it sucks that sally and i can't even have a simple talk about anything - and neither one of us really know anything about what each other is up to do or doing... so i mean its hard.
253-i talked to a few girls this weekend which i suppose is progress, but i talked about all the drama which i'm sure was not too impressive... i'm still standing strong on the whole being single thing until june next year.. who knows how that will end up - but fuck at least i got a goal?
254-i still sit and hope sometimes that when my phone rings its her... and we're going to be able to have a civil conversation and do some catching up.. but those hopes fade away quickly when i see the reality of who is calling.
255-i wont deny it.
256-i miss her.
257-ahhh here is some cool shit - i went to JD's piano bar the other day and they called me up on stage as i was up there having a song sung to me... this girl was right at the stage sitting behind the bar that seperates the stage from the chairs... she was standing up... little cute mexican girl... so i picked her up.. over the bar.. and brought her on stage with me... 10 minutes later... she was gone :(  i thought that was kind of funny.
258-*sigh* so tonight i'm staying home... gonna do some cleaning up... tomorrow ... work :(.... and then gym... then.. we're having a small get together at our place for like a ... house warming gig... so.. i'm out like a gangstah in the night....  - dont hate  secret note:  hazards 3 times / all the way down the road.
259-having a good weekend so far.. last night was in downtown pontiac for a festival...tonight and tomorrow night are ....   classified information  .
260-sorry :(  okay,  will post more when i get back home sunday!!
261--peace         
             i guess i should pay my web hosting bill so that i can continue this wonderful, exciting, humanizing journal.
262-until i do i think i'll still make a quick post.
263-i never imagined that becoming single would cause my life to become more exciting.
264-for the last five nights in a row i have been out and have met so many awesome people its.. a bit over whelming.
265-i wouldn't trade being able to go to different places, and seeing different people, and meeting different people, and forming my own group of friends for anything.
266-it truely is as if my life is begining to venture out on its own - last night i got my first .... phone call that was like... "hey come party"... so of course last night i partied.
267-*sigh*  june 5th 2005 still going strong...   wed night was crazy.
268-i went to jd's in pontiac which is this little dope piano bar... it was a pretty laid back atmosphere until i had 13 beers in my system and they were about to close - and the guys on the piano started playing loose yourself by eminem... yea things got a little crazy.
269-*sigh* so after the bar let out.. i ventured to find my car - which was no where to be found... we did find it the next day though after i had to call some girl to give me a ride back home because we had no ride.
270-i got home and...
271-PASSED RIGHT OUT.
272-it was over.
273-tonight we're going to some big party @ eastern for a few hours then ending the night in ann arbor for UofM party.
274-*sigh* all of this partying.... but hey i'm meeting lots of new people.. doing lots of new things...  okay.. bye :)         
                so yeah.
275-we beat the lakers.
276-crazy eh?
277-if you want too know more about that you should have watched the game ;).
278-so tonight was a pretty fun night.. it started out as a little party... became a bigger party... and ended as a huge party.
279-drunk?
280-well of course.
281-at some point last night we ended up in royal oak... in the middle of a riot ... where police on horses were yelling at us to stay on the sidewalk.
282-it was a tad obnoxious but hey i'm kind of use to obnoxious things ;)  after the royal oak world war III we grabbed something to eat... met up with a couple other people.. and went to downtown rochester... and.. well... another fucking riot atmosphere... we met some people down there though - ended up going to their house and partying.
283-over all it was a fucking great night.
284-still going strong on june 5th 2005 though ;)    -good morning         
             tonight was the first night i have actually went out and had a good time without thinking of all of the drama that has been surrounding my life lately.
285-my buddy mike and i started our night out by going and seeing "the day after.." the movie was ... alright.
286-we followed up the movie by hitting up peppi's sports bar and had a few drinks, he sang a few songs, i rejected a few chicks - and then we continued on with our wonderful night.
287-i didn't realize until the way home.. that i didn't think about all of this bullshit once tonight.
288-now that is progress.
289-let me tell you.
290-so i'm sitting here drunk and ... fixing to goto bed because it is an early morning i have to go to work and do the responsible thing... ya know?
291-(some people have to work for what they want / have) and for those that don't ... yes i'm jealous... but at the same time i also have something that you guys lack.. its called pride.
292-something you will swear you have for the things that are given to you..which you probably do have a bit of pride in the things that are handed too you - 5 years down the line compare your feeling now to the feeling you will have when you get something on your own ;).
293-Yes that was a stab at some people.
294-anywho...
295-So last night Mike and I went to a get together @ his frat buddies house - watched the pistons game which was just unfuckingbelievable... shortly after the pistons game we decided that we were in the mood to celebrate so we went to tonic and got drunk!
296-drank, danced... chatted a bit... it was an overall pretty good fucking night.
297-okay.. so .. i'm out like the drunk guy i am... work in the morning.
298-:(   -goodnight :)           
             i've got what i want... she wont call or contact me anymore... so the games finally over and its time to rebuild, recoup, find happiness alone, and then venture off into the world again as a stronger person.
299-i'm letting everything go... not holding on to the anger or hurt anymore... it takes to much effort.
300-so i'm ending it on this note... i wish her the best of luck in all her future endeavors - and i hope that she is able to get out of life everything she hopes for :)  goodluck sal :)  -peace         
             this morning i woke up to my mom coming in my room @ 8 am telling me "sally is on the phone for you".
301-i was a bit excited, a bit scared, a bit ... excited.
302-when i got on the phone we talked for a minute and i found out that she had woke up late for her ACT's - and did not know what to do - so without coaxing her too much i persuaded her to come over to my parents which she did - horrible mistake.
303-after about an hour or so.. we bullshitted a bit / i pissed her off / and she left.
304-we then decided through phone conversation and online conversation that we just needed to stick to our original plan (read last post).
305-so there i am just trying to do what i have too to please her and make her happy... and then...  i get a text message on my phone that says "what u doin?"
306-- I respond to her and let her know what i'm doing and she is just totally pissed off thinking i'm doing something else - which i can understand only because my AIM away message said "out with mike" and i'm telling her i'm at my sisters dance recital.. anywho... so we fight fight and fight... then when i get home from the dance recital... i have an IM on my screen.
307-sally (5:34:12 PM): out w/ mike?
308-going on a cruise?
309-i was going to tell you something, but i'm not anymore...nothing matters...sorry for IMing you.... my parents are here now, along w/ steph....i'll talk to you when i talk to you....  buh-bye...have fun tonight....i will too, don't worry.
310-later.
311-Auto-response from ClownSteve (5:34:12 PM): ... out with mike ....   so i'm not sure what the fuck....to do.
61-*sigh*.
313-anyways... so i tried to call her after i got that message to see what it was that caused her to unblock me, then message me, then get pissed off and rub in my face that she was going out too and she was going to have fun... i honestly don't get it.
314-senseless drama.
315-why couldn't she just call me if she had something ot say?
316-i don't get it.
317-anyways so we had our last communication... and now i'm off to cresent lake inn... i'm going to the bar for the first time in a year too try and ... "have fun tonight".
318-the only down fall to all of this is that i'm having to go with someone that dont like bars (my brother)... so its probably not going to be all that fun but fuck.. who knows...  1 year no sex, no girls.
319-thats my plan.
320-anyways so thats my post about today... life almost started to feel like it was kicking me in the ribs again... i had to look in the mirror and tell myself i'm sick of it.
321-*gets back up with confidence*   -goodnight         
             we finally came to the "official end" of our legacy.
322-i'm sad but spirited, sulking but joyful.
323-it was that time we couldn't go on anymore struggling to stay happy, having to hide under the radar from families to stay joyful.
324-every good thing has its end, and tonight was our end.
325-we ended as best as could be expected, with a hug, and a good-luck.
326-do i see anything in the future for her and i?
327-i don't know - i made up my mind a few weeks ago i'm trying not to think of her at all in my future because when i do that all of this hurts more... i miss her.. i love her... and i'll always care about her, she will always remain special in my heart...she can always call me when she needs too.
328-i love her.
329-so tomorrow i start on to a new journey - one which i'm excited yet scared to death of.
330-i'm going to start our simple my 1 year plan goes as follows:  1. job security 2. finance security 3. family 4. friends 5. relationship  i think i'm going to take a couple months off of girls in general...that way i can focus on myself.
331-something i need to do.
332-so no more booty for steve for months to come... no more anything really.
333-i'm changing my life.. and the change starts now... right this minute... going to bed early :)  -goodnight         
             80% done with the move... have a few pieces of furniture i need to take care of but other than that i got just about all the important things at my parents house now.
334-i'm here (at the apartment) right now... its rather empty yet still much more relieving then staying at my parents, which was the original plan.
335-heh not all of us can go from being in unsheltered freedom / back to our parents and have a smooth transition.
336-;)  anywho.. i will be out of here tomorrow for good.
337-i'll be at my parents house for a few days until i get another place to stay soooo i will have internet but wont be on it as much... thats all that happened today.
338-so shit was going good and had a real nice feel to it... but then my phone rang... =\   wont get into that.
339--goodnight         
             as i sit in a room glared at by bare walls i have to tell myself i wasnt expecting this at all.
340-i flick my ashes and watch them float to the ground i notice i hear nothing there is no sound.
341-a place paid for with hope and destined to fulfill dreams yet no one is here sitting with me.
342-sometimes i can still hear the joy i still here our pride when we brought home our boy.
343-the visions we shared and the future we planned now all appears to just have been a scam.
344-two months later im all alone sitting on the floor holding my phone wishing i knew the next place i would call home.
345-i'm packing the apartment / plan to move out tomorrow / well at least move my belongings to my parents house (hopefully) and then set out to find a place to live.
346-being here i'm so far away from everything in the world that matters to me, i mean the only reason i was here .... was to convinence sal.
347-so i'm going back up north to be near my job, family, friends...not quite sure where i'm going to live right now i suppose an apartment is out of the question with capone being my sidekick - not too many apartment complexes are going to allow a german shepard... so a house is definitly my only option right now *sigh*.
348-sorry for the bad picture... camera phone... gotta love them ;)  okay thats it.
349--goodnight         
             i'm begining to realize.. i don't need her.
350-*sigh* i never thought i would say that but i'm saying it.
351-each time we talk on the phone there is this feeling, or lack there of that haunts me - its this feeling of unhappiness.
352-i'm not sure why i'm devoting so much effort into something that should be so natural.
353-i'm begining to think that sally is more of a convience than anything.
354-i'm trying to force love, love that isn't there anymore.
355-*sigh*   i'm begining to see all this..  i know that its possible for me to be happy with out her in my life, that is something that i've never realized before - but i'm realizing it now.
356-she has been gone a week, and although i have spent that week alone in my apartment, i've spent this week reflecting on how 'alone' really feels.
357-although i look forward to her phone calls, and hearing about her escapades - it does not excite me that i will be seeing her friday.
358-it scares me more than anything.
359-we are so up and down.
360-i just don't think there is love anymore - on either side.
361-its about that time where her and i are going to go our seperate ways, i feel it.. and for the first time i'm not going to fight it or object to it.
362-i'm ready to walk down the new street to see what life has to offer me.. i mean if its meant to be it will happen right?
363-we both just need time to find happiness within ourselves again, and in that time we may find other people, we may not, but one thing is for certain - we would be much happier down the road if we were to ever get back together, than we would be if we continue ... "this".
364-this sucks.. i hate it... but when i've come to these conclusions.. something is wrong.
365-i've lost hope.
366-whos knows.. we'll see how things go... its Wednesday morning...see how many more days her and i are able to stand each other... i predict 4.
367--goodnight         
               is it possible for us to    get along   ?
368-glad she has hope.
369--goodnight         
             *sigh* its not possible for me to describe the confusion that i'm going through right now.
370-i just wish that we could go back to being happy, living with one another.
371-although that is just a wish / want / hope / its impossible; yet nothings impossible?
372-bullshit.
373-so here we go another attempt at being 'together' - with the entire world against us something that in the past we have failed miserably at.
374-the only way we could possibly win this battle was to "have nothing to loose" which isn't the case.
375-sally has everything in the world too loose in this battle.
61-*sigh*.
377-the only thing i have to loose is her, yet she is my everything.
378-i'm so fucking stuck..  enough with that shit.
379-i sat around today waited for her phone call, took capone for many walks - he definitely got his work out on today.
380-as i type this he is passed out in his cage - tired as fuck.
381-sally called sometime tonight too let me know she made it safe to Vancouver, that was cool...i guess she is coming home this friday... i'm pretty stoked... hopefully nothing happens before then.. i'm not planning on friday.. i started taking her and i day by day... that way if something happens between her and i.. the hopes / dreams / plans that are lost with her... aren't there too hurt.
382-i can't wait until i have happy / positive things to post about... i really wish i could write... "we're living together again" ... but somethings.... are just...  fucking impossible.
383--goodnight         
             soon after..that last post... @ 1:12 am, she called.
384-in a slumber whisper she told me, she missed me... and that i was.. her boyfriend... and she was my girlfriend... shit just can't stay consistent.
385-*sigh* i don't know what i'm going to do now...i was already feeling the "friend" thing...but i'm not going to be picky... i'll take her anyway i can... and this way i can still get booty.. so all is well :)  just wanted to update everyone.
386-okay for real now.
387--goodnight         
             its been along time since i've had to question the status of sally and i.  the last few weeks, almost a month now it almost seems as if it is a constant habit having to question this.
388-the day before she left for vacation (saturday) we met... and there was "i love yous" there was.. hugs and most importantly there was some kisses.
389-now.. we mock the whole idea behind being "friends" because at the end of the day technically that  is  all we are.
390-the night before she left though - she told me that she thought that our friendship 'was moving too fast' and if we continue the way we were going that i would never change.
391-so i simply agreed with her and continued to tell her that i was happy with her JUST in my life, and was not going to be picky about however that may be.
392-yet on the phone with her before we let each other go.. i did tell her i loved her once again, not because i was looking for it to come back out of her mouth - but only because i knew she was traveling the next day... and when i feel like telling her, "hey i love you" before we get off the phone... i'm going to do it - i mean if something were to ever have happened to her on this vacation... i would hold a lot of regret in my heart for not saying it soley because we are 'friends'.
393-friend or no friend - guess what - i love her.
394-=*|  so now she is on vacation - and i'm stuck here not having the slightest clue what her and i are...she said this morning when i repeated to her "we're just friends.." she said is that why we were saying i love you, yesterday??
395-so dude i'm fucking confused, yet again... and i'm not quite sure what to do with it... its 11:30 pm here... 8:30 pm there and i haven't heard from her all day.
396-so i'm stuck... confused... mad... confused?
397-WILL SOMETHING JUST HAPPEN ALREADY!!!!
398-OKAY.
399--goodnight         
                ronald reagan died today         
             so the pistons take on the lakers this sunday for the nba championship, this should be some what interesting.
400-right?
401-= today was kind of boring, basicly did a whole lot of nothing.
402-after my morning fiascos i came home for a few minutes then shot straight back up north to see sally... heh 50 miles one day and recently i'm finding myself doing that trip....twice.. three times a day... wow.. gas =\  anyways... we met up at mcdonalds and from there basically we just went too best buy.. left there and.... thats about it =\  (would like to give more details but have to respect her right of privacy)  on my way home from there i got really pissed off at the thought of driving another 50 miles back to an empty apartment, i mean i spend the majority of my time here alone - and its just to a point now that i can't stand it ... and the thought really puts anger in me.
403-(heh as i'm typing this capone just went in his cage and went to sleep).
404-so today i decided i was going to try and get a hold of my buddy that just got out of the army like last sunday... and i hadn't seen him - so i did / he came back down to my apartment with me and we did a lot of catching up.... none the less that was boring too :(  so i drove another 50 miles back up north to drop him off back at home (he decided to tell me he had a car on our way back).
405-heh its so funny / i realize that my days are so boring .... its my thoughts... my emotions... and basically how i think that seems to be so compelling... yet i find it hard ... to actually write about those in a public enviroment such as this.
61-*sigh*.
407-heh okay.
408--goodnight         
             just a quick note.
409-i never intended for this to be a "daily" journal - it just turned out that way.
410-Having this journal is a unique experience, it gives me a place i can come too and vent and allow people to vent with me, agree, disagree, offer advice, opinions but it also gives me the ability to remain private.
411-although i seldomly keep a post from being published, when i do i usually have reasons why.
412-the last two days ... and possibly some days too come.. if you notice a lack of posting and updates, this isn't because i'm loosing my motivation too post, its me just keeping some of my days private.. i post every single night... before i close my eyes.
413-whether or not i choose to share them... is my discretion.
414-so i'm still alive... the last two days have been hell.
415-tonight turned out better than i originally expected it too... but then again... i'm not sure i go into my days with any expectations anymore...except... my dog to listen?
416-heh... thats my post for the night :)  -goodnight         
             today was hell.
417-in the wake of our Wednesday night just when things started to feel normal again - with the lack of sleep .... and the over whelming frustration of the 'changes' happening between her and i... things went to shit.
418-we fought / went to bed / woke up and here we are again.... "ended".
419-i begged and pleaded all day and just when i was finished doing so... there you are ready to hang out and squash the entire episode... like this is a fucking game.
420-you heard me earlier on the phone.. ya know?
421-you know how upset all of this is making me... you know what you are capable of doing to me... yet one thing was different this evening... ALL day and early night you fucking treated me like total shit, and acted as though what i was going through didn't matter too you and you gave two shits about how i felt only about what you wanted, and about what you felt... you hardly gave me the time of the day other than answering your phone... yet one thing i did notice tonight that will help me out in the future...  the moment i came to reality... that there was nothing i could do, and i am so sick and tired of one day bonnie and clyde against the world / next day bonnie and clyde shooting each other.... that i calmed down and acted like the shit didn't phase me.
422-the minute you called and heard that i was calmed down and i wasn't "emotional" about it anymore... then we were able to fucking squash the stupid bullshit and hang out and actually treat one another like humans... wait on that note... when don't you get treated like a human... i believe that if i talked to you the way you talk to me everytime you get mad... just talked to you ONCE like you talk to me all the time when your mad... you would leave... but i dont.. i stick around... and ya know.. i cant blame a single soul but myself when this hits rock bottom... because i see what your doing... i see what your capable of doing to me... and yet i stand around and take it ... because i have one thing that no matter what... WONT go away....  hope.
423-.....if you guys only knew....         
                my day *sigh* ;)         
             today we met up around 4... and it turned out to be a fruit bowl of emotions from the very begining.
424-a major part of me was happy to see you, and feels completed when your around - it just feels "right".
425-then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again.
426-in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.
427-but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.
428-although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the CVS to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, "i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you".
429-the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.
430-it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.
431-when i'm not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i've been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.
432-so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i'm not in her life - which i'm sure doesn't take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void.
433-as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i'm living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i "lived in michigan" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.
434-then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.
435-be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.
436-this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally.
437-this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn't do... but i do.
438-so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.
439-its sad really.
440-so i'm not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i'm going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.
441-we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we're able to survive this.
442-*sigh*           
             i think the poem actually speaks for itself - so there is nothing i can really add.
443-except, comment of course.
444-windows are down as the cool breeze goes by the music is on low so i can hear myself drive  i watch the lines in the road as they go by slow i hear the raine hitting my tires as if it were snow  i can smell the humidity flowing in the air my face is getting wet and i just dont care  every few seconds i watch my windshield get wiped its just at that moment i realize how alone i am tonight  i pull over in a empty lot with really bright lights i get my pen and pad cease the moment and start to write  i begin to observe all which i can see i begin to realize no one else is around but me  i ask myself questions hoping my heart will be honest i ask myself if im able to not be with her this august  its her birthday in 11 days and she is so far away how did all of this happen why wont we share that day  things im pondering inside my mind sitting in the car on august 10th instead of being with her ill go to the bar  not to drink away my pain and sorrow but to celebrate my life and the new tomorrow  1 year ago we were together in texas the farthest thing from our heads was that we would ever be ex's  part of me of course wishes that all of this was a dream but then again if it was i would have never found me  a guy that can sit in a empty lot writing his thoughts a guy that never use to give up on life but always fought  a guy that believed in himself every step of the way a guy that struggles for his future but still knows how to play  a guy that is secure enough to write how he feels a guy that is strong enough to stand up for his ideals  i realize that no matter what is going on with my mind im so happy in life right now why even look behind  life is music and you just have to learn how to dance i think i've learned enough now, i'll give love another chance  here i am sitting alone in this lot with not a bit of fear if i could be anywhere else in the world i'd still be right here.
445-its 5:30 pm and the invites to places have already began to pour in for tonight.
446-yet i'm still so fucking clueless as to what i'm going to do - what should i do?
447-this is the question i'm left pondering.
448-although i'm totally not in the mood to sit at home tonight i'm also really not in the mood to be in the "club" atmosphere.
449-i do have some options though lets see this is what has presented itself to me this afternoon.
450-1) Canada with like 12 people 2) Saginaw street 3) I'm making this one up right now - The Movies  i suppose the movies would be the best choice because i mean thats more along the lines of what im in the mood to do, now the question is, who the fuck do i go to the movies with?
451-everyone already seems to have plans.. i don't have a girl (nearby) that i can take, blah.
452-maybe it'll end up just a 'steve night' - yeah.. that sounds rather refreshing actually, i think i might just go by myself to the movies.
453-now if you guys wanna show up and watch the movie with me your more then welcome.
454-i think i'm gong to go see the villiage at the star theater by great lakes crossing probably between 9-10.  this is just about the only thing i can think of doing that appeals to me, BUT who knows feelings change, moods change, plans change and then... you get an updated journal entry and see the result of all my trying to plan attempts.
455-okay i'm going to eat a bologna sandwich.
456-peace.
457-"..help is on the way.."  is what they chanted as john kerry made promises and gave hope to all americans in his speech.
458-it was almost as if i was watching a classic wrestling match, the way the crowd interacted with him and said it in unison.
459-it's 4am and i've just finished watching the speech for the second time.
460-there were a few statements that he made that i just have to mention, so here i go :)   "we don't go to war because we want too, we go to war because we have too"    "And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class.
461-You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months.
462-So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.
463-I will reduce the tax burden on small business.
464-And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education."
465-"The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans.
466-But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.
467-Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill.
468-Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans."
469-very cool john:  "I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents.
470-Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division.
471-Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States."
472-these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.
473-i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.
474-i'm looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before.
475-maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?
476-something i will consider :)  right now this is the place where i come to write, and right now, this minute... this is all i can think of writing about because it has consumed my day, and my thoughts.
477-for a full transcript of johns speech  urlLink click here .
478-2008 i'll be part of this:    -goodnight.
479-so have you guys been paying any attention to the democratic national convention?
480-i'm sure you've seen bits and pieces on the news - since this is my journal and not political oriented i'm not going to rant and rave about the convention, or my views, nothing like that.
481-i'm going to simply post an over view of trends i'm noticing.
482-one thing interesting about this election, is that "blogging" is actually becoming a voice on the web.
483-at this years DNC there is a whole slew of "bloggers" that were invited to come and document the convention, as part of the press.
484-that is amazing.
485-here is a picture of them setup at the convention.
486-this is something new that has never been done before, its as if we (bloggers) are begining to have an impact just as powerful is that of a journalist that types their opinion in the columns of worlds most powerful newspapers.
487-this is moving.
488-although my blog is more of a personal blog than a political blog, those of you that know me, know that i am very passionate about my beliefs and feelings on politics.
489-so i've added some links to the right hand side, that i'm reading every day to keep in touch with whats going on at the DNC, that we don't see come through the tube.
490-also i was able to find a good article full of links and information about " urlLink blogging from boston ".
491-so is everyone excited for a new president?
492-prepare.
493-:)         
             they say you can not help how you feel, and i'm here to testify that this is the truth.
494-its impossible.
495-if it were divorce rates would be on a stead decline by now.
496-on that note - i am not superman, i'm human.
497-i bleed, i suffer, i breathe, i feel.
498-you all know who i'm talking about in this poem, but try to look past that and focus  what  i'm talking about in this writing.
499-i think the majority of you guys will enjoy it.. i'll turn on comments for it.
500-let me know your thoughts, and as long as they are constructive i'll continue to let you know mine.
501-the smell of your skin is still tainted in my mind the warmth of your body at night knowing you were still mine  passion in our actions as we kissed away our days the sleepless nights that i would lay awake and pray  your hand upon my leg as we drive into the stars beyond the physical touch your passion went so far  chasing you to the room just to throw you down sitting on top of you staring not making a sound  eyes talking as if they were mouths emotions so pure they pour right out  as we would bath together i could smell your hair taking it for granted now i just think of you there  it is all the small things that i have grown to miss its the simple taken for granted things like a small kiss  feet cold enough to freeze the sun and cause a storm yet everynight i knew it was my job to keep them warm  no insecurities or doubts in my head just knowing you cared enough to look ahead  the dependence you put on me to become a man the dependence i had in you for you to hold my hand  i miss the romance and passion and comfort of love i miss the small things all the way down to a hug  i miss everything in life being more because it was you i miss the goodnights and the i love yous because i know they were true  so these are my secrets that my heart can not hide these are the feelings that im left dealing with inside  is there a cure for all of these deep thoughts will i ever find this again or are they lost.
502-answer to email: the title "message in a bottle" is perfect for this poem.
503-i wrote it and threw it in the ocean.. now we are going to see who reads it.
504-thanks for the note though :)            
             hahaha i never thought this site was ever important enough for "fan art" but apparently i might have to go ahead and make that section... haha this is from my friend nina... its ... so real looking.. but anyways.. thought you guys might get a kick out of it :)  thanks nina, it made me smile.
505-*note: the site is not broke, i've disabled comments for awhile.
506-i've needed to get away for a minute, and just have not had the oppertunity with work and everything.
507-so this weekend i ended up going 4 1/2 hours north west to the other side of michigan to go camping for a day with my family.
508-i was apprehensive at first only because, i generally don't like hanging out with my family - but it ended up being a blast, the family got along great - everyone was laughing, in fact i had such an amazing time that when it came time to leave there tonight - i hesitated cause i was having so much fun.
509-wierd eh?
510-so anyways sunday morning i went and picked chad up, and we drove out there together - it was a good road trip there was a lot of scenic shit.
511-none the less we got up there and found the camp ground (after using the fucking sun to navigate cause mapquest was WRONG!)
512-so we get up there my parents are not even @ their campsite so ... we go driving around this town to the sand dunes and look for them and low and behold we find them!!
513-what are the chances, anyways sooooooo we ended up going out to the sand dunes in my dads truck... sunday night and having a complete blast out there, driving up these steep fucking hills and back down them... it was ... something you would have to experince my words won't actually tell you anything... but you'll be able to tell from the pictures what i'm talking about.
514-i watched my second sunset in my entire life!!
515-(check out the pics) the first time i seen one was when i was visiting out in san francisco (sun sets right there), and the second one was here... the only thing that was missing... was while i was sitting there watching it... i was IN ANOTHER WORLD wishing someone else was there sitting next to me, buttttttttttt yeah actually... that was the entire trip i wished she was there...   i didn't even see this picture until i got home and downloaded the pics, someone must have took it while i was there day dreaming...   we got back to the campsite and sat around the fire telling jokes and what not, it was quite wierd - for the first time in ... my entire life i felt like ... we were a family.
516-then i realized lyndsey wasn't there, but it still felt good.
256-i miss her.
518-anyways it was odd.
519-i woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and we went RIGHT back out to the sand dunes where we seen a car flip (no one was hurt) and .. we got some more amazing photos of these guys on dirt bikes... flying through the air... all around it was goooood fucking times... my first family vacation i can actually say i enjoyed (even though i did only last a day)... i enjoyed it.
520-would have enjoyed it more if you were there though..  so thats my post... hope you guys enjoy the pictures... here i'll make it easy here is a link   urlLink click on sand dunes   sooooo thats my weekend, i wish i had more interesting things to say but i dont.
521-so... goodnight... and farewell!!
522-comment on pics  -peace  *ps* - i read  your  comment - thanks for the good luck wishes.
523-today was very uncomplicated.
524-around 7ish mike and i went to tiki bobs for nicks free party pass thing, we were able to drink for free until nine.. and we took advantage of that.
525-while i was there i ran into some old high school buddies which was fucking amazing cause i have anot seen them fucks in almost 5 or 6 years... so that was awesome.. we left tiki bobs and headed to rochester to the main street grill, where we all played each other in some pool.
526-we did have plans that followed main street, and that was to go see a movie, but that all changed when drinks got in us - we decided to roll back over to nicks house and play presidents and assholes... a drinking game, so we picked up a case on the way from cvs andddddd drank our asses off for a little while - i know i got fucked up pretty bad at one point, i had to lay my head on the couch and shut my eyes for a bit - but then i woke up, sobered up, drove home and most importantly made it home safe... its 3:21 am so i did good.
527-side note:  DONT DRINK AND DRIVE - ONLY FUCKING IDIOTS DO THAT SHIT!!!
528-one day i will practice what i preach until then think of my is king hypocrite, think of me however the fuck you want to think of me.. but i know a few of you guys that read this ... drink and are not even old enough to drink so.. let it me known... if you need a ride... call me see if i'm sober.. if i'm not... i'll pay for a taxi.. alright?
529-beat your fucking asses you drive drunk... lyndsey..kelly... dana....jessica..  okay so that is my night... i think i'm going to go to sleep now... so goodnight.
530-well yesterday was kellys birthday - she was totally not looking forward to it, i happened to read her journal and just felt bad for her, so i made sure i was the first one to wish her a happy birthday :P .
531-apparently she got a expensive digital cam for her birthday, can't be mad at that kel :P  anyways hope you had a happy birthday - you were in my thoughts :)  i'm not sure what is going on with my dad.
532-after all the drama i wake up to emails from him inviting me to go camping with him this weekend - i was a bit shocked.
533-i ended up calling him, and found out chad (my brother) was going to be over there, so i shot over there and hung out for awhile.
534-ending up laying in the pool for a little while then i had to take off.
535-it was relaxing just to be in a pool, its been awhile - haha i love to swim so much.
536-this past winter my old sidekick and i ran up in hotels and used them for their pool, and then we would bounce and go home.
537-it was gangster.
538-anyways so yeah it was nice to fucking lay out in the pool.
539-left there came home and just got really lazy and bored.
540-it was.. disgusting really.
541-at some point i think around 10:30 i decided to go out and went over to tonic for a little while, had a few drinks, danced, but the most interesting part of the whole entire night i would have to say was....  i was up at the bar just kind of observing the dance floor, when i noticed this black man walk by me - wearing this necklace that was blinding, straight bling.
542-as i looked up at his face, it was almost as if recognizing a child hood friend - obie trice was a hand length away from me... as i looked at him he looked at me.. i kind of grinned like.. i know who you are none of these fuckers do.. i was like whats up man.. anyways we ended up talking for about 10 minutes - i told him his CD was one of the better CD's to come off the shady imprint since the eminem show, he smiled and said "listen to this..." and pulled a cd out of his pocket - it is just a burned CD straight out of the lab, bad ass song - produced my eminem.
543-he ended the conversation by saying, "alright man i have to get up there.." (V.I.P) - it was dope.. but the dopest part after he walked away from me, he came back like 5 seconds later and was like whats your name again... who knows small world whatever.. he dont remember it now..  sooo i'm home now... been home for awhile... waiting for lynn to get online because i really wanna talk to her... she is on the phone right now :(  so thats just about where my night stands right now... i'm watching the dave chappelle show - erika badu or however you spell her name is doing a performance... alright well.. i'm out like a thief in the night :)  -night.
544-ps.
545-let me know what you guys think of the new look.
546-:)         
             i breathe in and blow it back out watch the smoke come floating out of my mouth.
547-i lean my head back and close my eyes and rest my body on the couch.
548-i begin to have thoughts of how i survived how im still here how im alive.
549-i dont know when it happened or how but its then i really begin to realize.
550-i dont feel the pain i dont think of you in vain to me your just a memory just a name.
551-i dont feel abandoned or left alone to rot i dont wish you were here im glad that your not.
552-i miss what we had but not all of the bad and i wouldnt take you back cause it would all come back.
553-i will search out another treasure that does not ever bring pain but only pleasure.
554-i pick up my head from leaning back on the couch i open my eyes and i know what all this is about.
555-i put out my cigerette with ease of mind, finally feel relaxed for the first fucking time.
556-i just realized where i am, im alone and surviving its proof that i can.
557-i felt the need to write what i realized tonight i know its a little sappy but thats alright  i couldn't help but share with everyone...  im finally fucking happy .
558-why am i up?
559-its 3:30 in the fucking morning there is no need for me to be up.
560-nothing entertaining is going on, there is no one to talk to online, and most importantly, i have a lot of things that i need to accomplish tomorrow.
561-why am i still up?
562-who the fuck knows.
563-the more i think about it, the more i fear i'll never get tired, so here i am - in an attempt to do something which ordinarily relaxes me :)  the stuff party last night was pretty dope.
564-by now the majority of you guys have seen the pictures, so you know it was looking like a good time.
565-to answer all of your questions at once, the band that was playing was darren mcarty's band (he is a defenseman for the detroit redwings) - they were alright.
566-the best part of the entire night was the fact that i got fucked up - i hardly drank a drop, but when it came to smoking - i smoked.
567-it was ... wonderful :)  i danced the majority of the night after the band got done playing - as a matter of fact i could not find it in me to stop dancing, i just danced... and danced... and danced.
568-came home, posted real quick, and crashed.
569-today was fun.
570-mike and i went to the rec center and practiced dodge ball, well that was the plan but seeings a lot of people did not show up we substituted our game for a quick run of the gym hitting the weights, and then for a quick game of one on one basketball.
571-so regardless we got our workout on.
572-we ended our wonderful day at arbys where we picked up dinner.
573-the minute i got home i showered because i was EXTREMELY hot.
574-that was fucking amazing - orgasmic really.
575-so now i'm up and i can't sleep.
576-but now i've posted, so maybe i'm relaxed enough to try again.
577-alright here i go ... 1... 2... 3...  latah.
544-ps.
579-i couldn't be happier with life right now :)         
               the party was fucking dope is hell!!
580-i danced my ass off for the majority of the night - and i didn't drink hardly anything (i did get high though)... not that much to post though... the party was dope... i had a blast... and there are new pictures :)   Enjoy!!
581--goodnight

             today was busy.
778-i'm not use to busy days :) it was nice.
779-mike and i took the girls back to baycity.. we stopped for lunch on the way home at A  W i didn't realize how good their fucking food was - i was diggin that place.
780-anyways i started the drive... and with the lack of sleep and the honestly not really paying attention... about 25 minutes into the trip... mike says, "dude we're going north.." so yeah.
781-i wasted alot of time driving in the completely opposite direction of home, so i pulled over and was like "your driving".
782-so i got the chill for a few hours on the ride home - it was relaxing although i didn't get to sleep as i had planned i was to caught up in the music... that happens sometimes.
783-after we got back home we chilled for a few minutes, and went directly to my dads house to go pick up all of my shit that he was storing for me - that was fun.
784-he is such a fucking idiot - he emails me and plays this hardass, that doesn't give a fuck about his kids, implies he pretty much hates us, and then when i show up expecting the worst he is going to act like he is my best friend.
785-what the fuck.
786-i said maybe two words to him, for the first 20 minutes while we packed up the back of mikes truck - and then all of the sudden i think he kind of detected that there was some tension coming his way from me - and he out of know where offered me to use his van with the trailer so i only had to make one trip... awww how nice of you pops, its the least you could fucking do.
787-i'm not going to complain, it made things a hell of a lot easier on time.
788-so i got to mikes and just threw all of my shit in the garage where i'm going to store it for now... i think i'll break into it tomorrow or something.. i don't know.
789-its going to be nice to have my desktop back though.
790-anyways.
791-so i left back towards my parents house to return the van and i heard a song... and the fucking song just fucked with me, i've heard it so many fucking times in the past but i've never listened to it - this time i listened to it ... and it fits... i dedicate to my parents (staind - for you).
792-got back with the van and my dad had company over, so as i went to go give him the keys and let him know i was leaving he became dad of the year and offered me dinner.
793-i was fucking shocked.
794-(no matter how much i hate you i can't turn down free food.)
795-so i ate.
796-then he said, "why don't you party with us tonight..." i almost started having seizures.
797-i think it is so funny that he thinks he can pop in my life and out of my life playing the dad role when its convient for him.
798-when no one is around and he is just miserable, he don't like me, or us for that matter.
799-but god damnit if his friends are around he is a "cool dad".
800-fuck you.
801-i hate you.
802-your a piece of shit of an excuse for a dad and i regret every single day of giving you another chance to be there and be a dad  ... i should have went with my fucking mom to florida.
803-i fucking hate him  .
804-but he don't think anything is wrong with him, he thinks everybody else is wrong.
805-lets look at the facts.
806-i moved out when i was 16  chad moved out when he was 17  lyndsey just moved out (she just turned 17)  kristyn left the day she turned 18   wow, i notice a fucking pattern.
16-blah.
808-i fucking hate him.
809-anyways so that was my night... well there was more buti can't talk about it cause it just don't involve me and it wouldn't be very nice of me to divulge other peoples business... ya know?
810-so yeah.
811-hope you enjoyed my post... its the first one in awhile that i'm venting in.
812-i'm pissed, i can vent right?
813-i can't be cool all the time.. shit gets exhausting ha.... alright enjoy ya'lls weekend :)           
             so yesterday was interesting to say the least.
814-mike and i met up with a girl and her friend (fahlon  krystal) up in baycity - which by the way was a long fucking drive.
815-so we went and picked the girls up, on the way home we stopped at burger king - which was kinda fun because they were wearing some skirts that were... lets just say 'short', and well it was windy outside :).
816-we got back to the house and just started to get fucked up.
817-i'm not sure why, i'm not sure how, i'm not sure even... when... but i know right after we arrived here we started drinking.. and then we ended up out in the garage smoking... eventually we ended up @ tonic night club dancing and drinking.
818-it was a pretty dope night - up until bed time, but thats another story in itself.
819-i'm sitting on the floor right now because i had to be the gentlemen and let them sleep in my bed, and well i've been awake laying on the floor since 3 am with no sleep- finally i decided i was going to call it quits and just stay up today because it would be pointless for me to even sleep, i still have to drive them home.
820-i'm not looking forward to today at all.
821-as soon as i drop them off back in baycity i have to go to my dads house and pick up all my crap from the old place and bring it over here - something i'm not looking forward too, nor do i want to do.
822-if the majority of the shit over there wasn't so fuckign expensive i wouldn't think twice about leaving it over there.
823-here is what i had in my inbox this moring :)        -----Original Message-----    F  rom: Stephen Parent [mailto:tool*****@hotmail.com]    Sent: Friday, July 16, 2004 3:55 AM    To: Steve Parent Jr    Subject: NOW  Stevie,    Come get your shit today or it will be moved to the purple heart or red cross I am not kidding.
824-god do i love my fucking father.
825-:) this should be fun - i'm sure i'll have a lot of wonderful things to post about tonight!!
826-blah fuck you pops!!
827-so i think i'm going to let them sleep for another hour, then wake their asses up so i can get my day started - they are some cool ass chicks to kick it with... we will probably do it again in the future.... so yeah thats my post.
828-oh yeah - new pictures :)    - good morning           
             ok, can i just talk about gw bush the 'good ole boy'?
829-i mean, come on...  gw bush went to andover.
830-and yale.
831-he's from greenwich, connecticut.
832-he vacations in maine.
833-and don't get me wrong, andover, yale, greenwich, and maine are all lovely places.
834-but they're not exactly breeding grounds for 'good ole boys' who drive rusty pickup trucks and herd cattle(gw bush most likely grew up stealing golf carts and occasionally riding polo ponies, both of which are fine adolescent, preppy pursuits, but are not the sort of pursuits that people associate with good ole boys from deep in the heart of texas).
835-it just galls me when gw goes out and plays cowboy and some of the voters actually believe that he's a man of the people.
836-gw bush exists to serve his billionaire masters, and that's it.
837-so the next time you see gw pretending to be a good ole boy or a man of the people just remember that he grew up summering in good ole greenwich connecticut getting drunk on golf courses and bragging about his rich daddy.
838-if gw bush is a cowboy from texas then i'm a weight-lifter from siberia.
839-just seen him on the news and got annoyed.
840--goodnight            
             for the first time in forever i forgot my phone in my car.
841-this is normal, as i'm sure that many of you reading this have done this as well.
842-it is abnormal for me though - ever since the bullshit... my phone is plugged in and charges in the same room as i am while i'm sleeping... well last night i forgot it in my car.
843-which i suppose shows progress... i mean before i'd get dressed up to go back outside and grab it before i goto bed... but last night, not a thought in my head about it.
844-so if that is any type of measure of my progress i suppose its a good steady incline of my overall progress, right?
845-there were a few 'firsts' for everything today.
846-when i woke up the first thing i did was LOOK for my phone, which was as i said - out in my car.
847-so i grabbed a cigerette and walked outside - go to my phone.. and someone called me @ 5 am... private name.
848-i have a very  strong  feeling who it was...and that to me is irony.
849-the first time i leave my phone in the car, she decides to call.. if that isn't a sign.
850-anyways.. i hope everything is fine with you, and everything is okay.
851-i remember what the '5 a.m.' phone calls are about.. and i hope your night was alright, drama free.
852-sorry i didn't pick up.
853-none the less...   there is nothing else to post.
854--goodnight         
               urlLink   
               urlLink   
             "honesty" it is something that i'm learning.
855-for in the past i would have been 'afraid' of sarah's reaction to "the truth" - but now i speak of nothing but, and the reaction is... at first is understanding and support - but the long term reaction is her disappearing out of my life.
856-do i regret telling her the truth?
857-not at all.
858-you see truth is always the best policy and the reward is often so much more than you expect.
859-yes it sucks that she does not want to see me or hang out with me because it sucks for her, but at least she knows that i was real with her - and we aren't ending for any "odd" reason for which she couldn't understand or comprehend.. we are ending because everything was put out in the open with my feelings - and it is simple to understand.
860-i miss her though *shrugs* but its best.
861-i think that was just considered, 'rambling' was it not?
790-anyways.
863-so today was pretty lame.
864-(as i'm typing this capone is laying on the bed with me ... making funny noises looking at me wanting to go to sleep - fuck i love him).
865-i stayed home most of the day... OH WAIT.
866-at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.
867-capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.
868-so back to my day.
869-i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.
870-got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly's apartment and watched "ghost ship" that is an alright flick.
871-not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.
872-one of those things.
873-i'm feeling better about everything.
874-i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the 'cloud' that over shadowed sarah and i's friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.
875-your thinking, "what cloud?"
876-- well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?
877-we have all been there.
878-so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.
879-i wasn't ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.
880-so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.
881-i'm going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.
882--goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy!
883-- capone shit  - cleaned up capones shit - went to techno fest - added new pictures to my pictures - started writing a book (more details later) - danced a lot tonight - kelly and jessica stopped over for a bit - talking to lynn right now - added new feature to site.
884-i can now call a phone number from my phone and record a message and it will post here to the site for you guys to listen too, when i'm not able to find internet access and i want to post.
885-so sometimes you'll get my voice opposed to this.
886-Example :   urlLink   
             last night i went to lush barroom again.
887-that was kind of cool.
888-afterwards i went to kellys apartment and attempted to watch fight club.
889-left there came home let capone outside, where he got bit by ants so i had to give him a bath at 6 am.
890-fun?
891-no.
892-then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn't end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.
893-sucked.
894-today i'm going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the 'techofest' which should be a blast, i'm excited for it anyways.
895-we'll see how that goes.
896-bye.
897-does he kiss you and give you butterflys?
898-do you see your future when you look in his eyes?
899-when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man?
900-when you lay down does he play with your hair?
901-when ever hes gone are wishing he was there?
902-when you fuck each other do you think of me?
903-do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve?
904-when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides?
905-does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares?
906-when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far?
907-would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you?
908-would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true?
909-do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look?
910-does he know what gets you going like he has read your book?
911-when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face?
912-when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place?
913-do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me?
914-do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve?
915-do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream?
916-do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back?
917-do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you?
918-do you ever wonder if i'm still in love?
919-do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs?
920-do you ever wonder if im fucking?
921-do you even care who i'm hugging?
922-does he kiss you and give you butterflies?
923-or is it just a coverup of how you really feel inside?
924-it is for me.
925-its 10:17 pm and i'm sitting here with capone.
926-lots of invites out tonight but i really felt the need to just relax tonight - my body feels so exhausted.
927-which is odd.
928-i eat better now than i have in the past year.
929-yesterday for example sarah grilled me some ribs, the day before that she grilled me some chicken cabobs, the day before that she grilled me some steak.
930-as i write this i'm wiping away juice from a fruit cocktail i just made after an extreme grocery purchase at meijers.
931-i often think to myself, sally would be happy to see how i'm living now opposed to how i was while we were together - but then i think to myself i wouldn't be living this way if she was here - i'd be too focused on other things.
932-so i'm not doing anything tonight - at all.
933-no sarah, no club, no bar, no drinking, no nothing.
934-me and my homie capone... chillin.. about to turn on the tv and see whats on.. probably fall into a deeeeep sleep.
16-blah.
936-im not in a good mood.
937--blah fucking blah.. goodnight.
938-mike, sarah, and i went to this club tonight.
939-it was the awesome!!
940-we ended up first of all walking in, not having to stand in a line - then i met the two girls that run the production company who hosted the party... and they gave us free drinks all night - i think between the three of us we bought... 1 drink.
941-we all got drunk very very very very cheap.
942-great music, great people, great atmosphere.. it was just as dope as it could be.
943-actually tonight was amazing.
944-i wish i would have taken my camera into the club so you could see pictures of mike breaking it down - hahaha i even got into the action.. we were having such a blast.
945-i danced with dana, it made sarah act a little wierd - that lasted for about 20 seconds i think when she realized i didn't really care what she thought - because i'm not going to be all up on her.. or any female for that matter ever again.
946-i'm gonna have fun and do what i want... because thats how its suppose to be.
947-so she didn't say anything to me and chilled out - and we ended up having a really goodnight.
948-we left there, dropped off sarah... and mike and i hit up the taco bell in waterford.
949-lol drunk and eating..it was such a good idea.
950-sarah?
951-yes here is a picture sarah  so this is sarah.. she is dope.. very sweet.. very kind... and she is  very  independent.
952-:)  anyways.. thats my day / night... and.. now i'm out like a gangster in a cop movie..
953-peaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!
954-oh wait.
955-thought i would mention.... stuff magazine party.. detroit... july 17th... catch me in the august issue... i will be sittin V.I.P with mikey and the family... hahaha I'M PSYCHED!!!
956--peace         
             today was kind of fun.
957-mike and i went to the 'village square' which is a mall based outside.
958-very neat.
959-it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the A/C.
61-*sigh*.
961-capone got some training today.
962-he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.
963-neat eh?
964-i guess the 'training' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.
965-he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.
966-i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.
967-after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah's house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.
968-we then proceeded to go to nick's house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.
969-came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).
970-i'm beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.
971-i feel like i'm slowing down time.. or i'm speeding up with it, and i'm beginning to catch up with everything about me.
972-is there still some things i want to change?
973-of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute.
974-(blah i'm rambling).
975-what i'm really trying to say is... i'm becoming more focused ... i'm becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.
976-today on the way home from sarah's house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.
977-wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.
978-now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i've had to deal with, but i wasn't as wise then - in fact i was nieve.
979-through this i've become more wise, and less nieve.
980-i will never gamble "myself" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.
981-never again.
982-so i'm becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.
983-i've become more wise.. and since you can't learn wisdom, and you can't teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i'm growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose.
984--goodnight.
544-ps.
986-new picture of capone... more on my pictures page.
987-...what..we were high @ 1:30 am...  ...more pics available in the picture section (link on right hand side).
988-i stare at your eyes and am too scared to see whats inside i lie awake staring at the ceiling wondering if this is keeping me from healing as much as i want this to grow i want it to be strong so lets keep it slow we are still friends but we both know its beginning to be as if this is all pretend the bridge of companion has not been crossed - but our friendship still remains at risk for loss a wonderful friendship filled with fun, to a relationship that i'm scared of and i might run  im beginning to feel as if its best we stay friends that way our beginning is guaranteed to have no end im not completely over her and this i cant pretend so please try not to be selfish and be there as a friend i just need some time to find what is mine again.
989-your to perfect in your own beautiful ways i totally enjoy your company every one of our days yet im beginning to loose my own fragile time i still need space for myself to reflect and unwind your friendship is rare and special to me i want more from you but right now this is all i need  friendship.
990-well lets see.
991-last night i spent the night with sarah again and we had long exhausting sex until the sun came up, it was outstanding.
992-actually i'm kidding but thats what people seem to assume when you mention staying the night with someone, well another sex i suppose.
993-with all the partying going on neither one of us were really in the mood to do much of anything, so we decided that we would just chill out - so we went to her house and grilled out... chicken cabobs... haha they were dope.
994-ran up to the party store and bought a 12 pack.. and we just sat around and drank some beer and talked all night - it was very relaxing.. i was.. happy.
995-update:   today i TOTALLY RELAXED.
996-it was wonderful.
997-at some point tonight i think around 12:30ish or so mike and i drove back out to waterford to meet kelly @ cvs and we smoked a bowl with her.... got some white castle after she finally found the one that she "knew".
998-yes that was wonderful.
999-that is all i did today it was a lot of fun actually.. i couldn't have enjoyed today more.
1000-tomorrows to do list: - bank - car insurance - condo - sprint - work at some point - possibly if time take capone out to park  thats it...   - peace  goodnight         
             well last night sarah, mike and i all went to kelly longs house and watched a movie...
1001-(Valentine?)
1002-with heather and her.. did some drinking.
1003-afterwards we took off and i ended up staying the night at sarahs because she was home alone (her moms out of town) and she wanted me to stay.. (wimp).
1004-so i stayed.
1005-today we woke up came and picked mike up and drove to the beach where i got a REALLY nice tan... pictures coming soon :P   then now i'm waiting for mike to get out of the shower.. we're going to get our hair cuts... picking sarah up... hitting up downtown detroit... and we'll see how the night plays out.
1006-hopefully i can get some good pictures of the weekend!!
1007-alright peace!!
1008-today was alright.
1009-didn't really do much.
1010-went to a soft ball game tonight with sarah and mike, we drank a few beers - then went to the bar with the team to celebrate their first victory.
1011-we ate pizza, drank beer.
1012-dropped sarah off, came home too let capone out and grab some.. goodz.. :)  left from here and went to jessicas.. picked her up... we smoked... came back to the house chilled watched "Ice Age" some animated flick.. got 3/4ers of the way through the movie and..... she had to go home...
1013-SO... went ALLLLLL the way back to 8 mile and dequinder and dropped her off... and now i'm just getting back...  thats fucking it..  had fun today but on the big scale of life.
1014-today was lame.. looking forward to the weekend.
1015--peace         
                COURT BIATCHHHHHHHHH!
1016-today was just... disgustingly      isn't that just fucking adorable?
1017-god i love this fucking dog.
1018--goodnight         
             this post will not be long tonight i don't think, but then again who the fuck knows.
1019-my mood the last few days has been quite cynical.
1020-which does not make sense since right this moment, i have more going for me in my life than i have in months.
316-i don't get it.
1022-anyways i already posted about this but i made it private.
1023-sorry i do keep somethings private, when i know its in my best interest.
1024-sue me.
1025-it is so hard for me to sit here and write, without venting.
1026-i've written 3 lines and just erased them.
1027-today was interesting.
1028-i got the job i've wanted forever.
1029-yes, caught you off guard did it not?
1030-i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of 'doubt' with getting the job.
1031-today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.
1032-he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.
1033-i'm fucking geeked.
1034-i have to tell mah people now that i'm going to be leaving them, they will get over it.
1035-so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.
1036-i will post more later on that subject.
1037-after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn't the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k?
1038-:)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.
1039-after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.
1040-we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.
1041-because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.
1042-it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.
1043-maybe one day i'll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn't even wanna talk about it.
1044-because it is so personal and deep.
1045-oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the "random" folder.
1046-i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i'm not going to tell you how.
1047-i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i'd feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn't kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i'd be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.
1048-that just came out as i was typing the post.
1049-sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don't think you'll find a negetive one so i think i'm entitled to being 'down' once in awhile... this was my night.
1050-dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.
1051-comments are off on this one.
1052--goodnight         
             today was interesting to say the least.
1053-i felt like i needed "alone time" today.
1054-i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.
1055-it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.
1056-it was peaceful.
1057-on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.
1058-so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.
1059-went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.
1060-i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn't trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.
1061-so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.
1062-tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i'm totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.
1063-it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.
1064-so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven't checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now.
1065-ClownSteve: you get the pics downloaded?
1066-Kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass out   so i guess i'll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.
1067-they are funny.
1068-okay i'm in for the night.
1069--latah         
             before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight   "can you imagine if peter parker was high?"
1070-"steve this thing is so long and big"  (burrito at taco bell)   "is this the CD?
891-no.
1072-then how are you starting it over?
1073-im not, its the radio."
1074-(Eminem - Stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.
1075-so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some "goods" we went and smoked, in kelly's apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it'd be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can't write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.
1076-it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.
1077-the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.
1078-who knows.
1079-tonight was pretty intoxicating though.
1080-i don't think i've laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.
1081-in a real long time.
1082-but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.
1083-there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.
1084-it was fun.
1085-i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.
1086-especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.
1087-anyways so i'm home now its 3:42 am.
1088-saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.
1089-it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.
1090-yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.
1091-it was sad.
1092-she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.
1093-she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn't let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.
1094-called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.
1095-none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.
1096-it takes a lot of stress away.
1097-so we partied there that night for a little while.
1098-haha i put saturday first.
1099-friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.
1100-i didn't end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.
1101-so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.
1102-the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.
1103-2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.
1104-well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.
1105-oh well - couldn't change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.
1084-it was fun.
1107-then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.
1108-i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo.
1109-so that was my weekend.
1110-and thats the end of my post.
1111--cheers.
1112-(should have pictures of tonight tomorrow)          
             Since I really have nothing else to post at this moment, I figured I would go ahead and acknowledge some of my favorite comments I've gotten.
1113-I guess Dana leads the group...
1114-I think ive read this like 5 times now.. and every time i read it i mean to leave a comment but I am either amazed or speechless at the end!
1115-I   You seem to have a lot of lady fans!
1116-Kepp it up lol    one of my favorites:  Your smarter than you act...    i liked this one a lot too:  ok i already told you this in IM but imma tell you again...this i think has to be my fav of yours.
1117-your stregnth amazes me...but you amaze me just about every day steve.
1118-you deserve to have a smile on your face at all times...and you deserve ALL the happiness in the world.
1119-lynn   this was funny:  you  mike = PIMPS  the end.
1120-lynn    this was touching:  Steve.. You are such an amazing person.
176-You inspire me with your perseverance  strength.
177-You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I've told you that since the day I met you.
178-You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up.
179-You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves.
180-I've never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life.
181-Your such a doll and I'm sorry for all that you've went through, I'm glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you.
182-Your amazing.
1128-Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :)    this one makes me smile when i read it:  w/e bitch!
1129-i knew where it was!
1130-lol u got ur sick ass white castle but those chicken things are kinda good- but maybe just cuz we smoked b4 that?
1131-touching as well:  Steve,  You know you're like a big brother to me.
1132-It's scary because you've been more of a big brother to me than my own brother has.
1133-I never really tell you but you mean a lot to me.
1134-As you've seen before, I'm always going to be here for you.
1135-Even though you may do something that prevents us from talking for long periods of time, I'll always be here if you need me.
1136-I know you're confused about a lot of things that are going on in your life right now, but you know that things will eventually work out for the best.
1137-Sometimes things have to happen to make your life better.
1138-All you have to do is try not to think about the things that have gone wrong, and think about the things you've gained back since that thing went wrong.
1139-Example: Me.
1140-:D haha anyway.
1141-As I was saying, you're a great guy and you deserve a great girl.
1142-You seriously deserve nothing less than the best.
1143-I know that when you give your heart to a girl you give it 100%, and if that girl can't appreciate that..she doesn't deserve you.
1144-I've been here for you since you were in the army with nothing to do but get on the internet and chat in vzones.
1145-I've heard about many things that have gone on in your life.
1146-One thing I've noticed about you is that you always pull through and come out of it learning something that makes you a better person.
1147-Just know that it will get easier, and you will find a girl that will make you happy.
1148-Just give it time and try not to think about the bad things.
1149-I'm going to end this here because I think I'm getting too mushy.
1150-I'll talk to you tomorrow.
1151-Love ya Steve, Alice    yea, this was original.
1152-worst comment so far:  hayy ur hott i have no idea who u r though i was on a website and then saw ur pic and i clicked on it so if u ever want to talk or somthin im me on xxblondebabe77xx    okay so those are the comments that I found that stood out.

0-       Yet another TV Channel.
1-This time it's called Zoom and comes from the Times group (Publishers of Times of India, Economic Times, Indiatimes, Femina and so on.
2-This channel will most probably be launched at the end of the month 28th August being a tentative date.
3-Professed to be aimed at the urban young, hip and happening is supposed to appeal to the consuming public.
4-Some of the programs to come  Page 3 (If it is from the house of Page 3, then how can there not be a program called Page 3) Not Just Page 3 ( The opposite of Page 3) Item Number Girl hunt (After the hunt for pop stars, film stars and what not, a hunt which is finally interesting...
5-The hunt for Item number girls)  I'll be getting to see some of the pilots next week.
6-so full reviews of them then...
7-I'm looking for the mp3 of the Gary Barlow song Open Road.
8-If anybody has links to it pls email  urlLink me           
             my new email address  urlLink chirag@chiragpatnaik.com           
             Kota is the place of the day, this city has the unique distinction in India to be the host for different kinds of power plants namely, Thermal, Hydroelectric and Nuclear power plants.
9-Your's truly has visited them all.
10-This city is also in the western state of Rajasthan.
11-It is very hot here in the Summer and almost nobody uses an Air Conditioner.
12-This place afforded the only stability for any length of time.
13-As I did my Class 10th 11th and 12th here.
14-Had a generally fun time, as everybody does in the final years of school.
15-We visited a lot of places in Rajasthan from here.
16-Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Bharatpur(the bird sanctuary), Mathura and had almost decided to go to Delhi in the same trip but wiser counsel prevailed.
17-I will want to go to this place, just to revive the memories of the good old days of school and the like.
18-Domains domains and more domains, I want more          
              My posts to the blog will still be daily though erratic.
19-This is because of me going underground to prepare for the upcoming interview in Calcutta, so I need to get in Shape and real fast that too.
20-Anybody who has a magic bullet for weight loss may please contact  urlLink me .
21-That's all for today folks.
22-The next city in the current series is Allahabad.
23-This city lies on the confluence of the three rivers the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati.
24-However, if you pick up the Atlas, you'll see that there are only two rivers.
25-What about the  third  river?
26-Well!
27-it is mythological.
28-Yes that's right it's Mythological.
29-it is reputed that the river Saraswati flowed there and due to some event (I don't remember what) it went underground out of shame.
30-The rivers in India have been personified, that's how the shame factor comes into the picture.
31-Anyway back to the city, A nice city to live in.
32-I did my class sixth and seventh here in different schools, namely the St Joseph's College and The Kendriya Vidyalaya, Manauri.
33-After this city I've always studied in Kendriya Vidyalayas(Central Schools in Hindi).
34-Amazingly there is nothing very remarkable about this city as far as modern times go.
35-But this city is steeped in Indian Mythology.
36-Lord Ram is said to have been here during his 14 years of forced exile.
37-Another feature of this place, the roots of a Banyan tree which gives of leaves(you've got to see it to believe it), the very same Banyan tree is said to be several Millenia old and the British even tried to set it afire (out of plain old Malice)so that we'd lose this part of our heritage, but this tree survived and is said to be one of the largest trees in India.
38-There is also a tunnel which is said to go all the way from Allahabad to Delhi.
39-People have tried to follow this tunnel but it ends due to a rockfall some distance inside.
40-I was here during the infamous Babri Masjid (Mosque) Demolition.
41-That was one shameful aspect of India's modern history, when a bunch of Hooligans decided to break down the Mosque.
42-There was a lot of tension because of the demolition and the Army had to do Flag Marches and the like in certain localities to calm things down a bit.
43-I was also here during the infamous Anti Mandal Commision riots.
44-The riots took place because of the provision for reservation for the Backward classes in the Government jobs and other government owned and operated institutions.
45-A lot of heartburn took place in this country because of that one man who was responsible for this.
46-The amazing part is that man is alive and hopes to enter active politics again.
47-(To dispel any confusion it was not Mr Mandal, But Prime Minister VP singh who actually implemented the commision report and is thus reviled for the reason).
48-I probably will never want to come back here again, simply because there is nothing to come back to.
49-And the Indian TimeZone in Blogger still does not work.
50-I'm registering domain by the dozen, u'r right I've nothing better to do.

61-Today's city is Srinagar, to those who haven't heard of Srinagar, it is the Summer Capital of Jammu and Kashmir, with Jammu being the Winter Capital.
62-It is not a very hospitable place now, due to the activity of Pakistani Terrorists in the Valley.
63-It is now a non family station for people like My father meaning families of Defence Personnel and the like are not allowed there.
64-Srinagar is famous for its Gardens by the Mughal Emperors of India in the Medeival ages, and also the Houseboats on the Dal Lake.
65-House Boats are just that Houses on Boats, and are now used as tourist hotels.
66-Correction,  were  used as tourist hotels, due to the activity of Pakistani Terrorists, no tourists.
67-Not only bad for tourism but also for the local people, as tourism is the mainstay of the local economy.
68-There will be sometime before normalcy returns, but it is unlikely as the Pakistani Government survives on Pure Hate.
69-If India vanishes tommorow the whole country of Pakistan will collapse.
70-or maybe not they already have America to hate and Russia and...

             Nice quote for the day...  "There's a warder who's fond of me.
294-I don't ask why, I've learnt to take what's there without questioning the source.

298-~from "The Passion", by Jeannette Winterson

               Does advertising have variations across the year?
301-was a question asked.
302-Of course.
303-and it varies differently for different categories.
304-As a broad and general statement for print, advertising peaks in October, with an immediate fall in November.
305-For the rest of the year it is more or less at a stable level, except for a slight dip in Feb, April and July.
306-Of course there is also the fact that there will be individual variations for different categories... woollens, cars, computers for obvious reasons.
307-Then there are special events like the world cup, which would bring about huge swells in spends.
308-This last world cup showed a monitored swell of 50% on print... amazing is the only word I can think of          
              urlLink INDIAN LINKS  was one of my earlier efforts at websites.
309-The attempt was to test stuff like Javascript, seeding search engines for better rankings and general stuff like that.
310-The search engine rankings worked (for sometime at least), I was number ONE on Altavista for some time... and once I even did a story on manipulating search engine rankings for  urlLink Education Times   Had never heard of software like Frontpage, so did everything, believe it or not in Windows Notepad.

314-Option of choosing only the pay channels one wants to watch.
315-More accountability of the cable operator towards the braodcaster.

317-Bah!
318-Thank God I never bought a TV...  More on CAS from  urlLink agencyfaqs.com           
              urlLink exchange4media  reports that there might be a shift of ad revenues from TV to print due to CAS (Condional Access System)...
319-Nonsense.
320-I think (like the other Media Planners quoted in the story) nothing of the sort is going to happen.
321-Silly to assume, that post CAS viewership and readership patterns will change...
322-In fact if the promise of cheaper cable comes through.
323-one might have more people opting for a cable connection.
324-My most favourite quote for today...

             For the people who are visiting this place and have no idea about what is a blog... here is a brief intro...  A Blog is short for WebLog.
337-It is nothing but a personal online journal.
338-In my case as the description on the side says, it is "The Ramblings and Rants of somebody in particular about everything in general..." :).
339-If you need pointers on how to get one for yourself, do drop  urlLink me  a mail...

341-I Did it :)          
             My Favourite Quote for Today...  "To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better...to know even one life has breathes easier because you have lived.
342-This is to have succeeded" - Ralph Waldo Emerson          
             I have to sit and enter the readership and circulation data for all the publications in India over the past 5 years... this is slowwww and painfull...
343-I think I may have finally figured how to get this working again...          
             apparently blogger can send posts by mail ad well... am trying to figure out a way to use it...          
             American shores beckon a batchmate of mine, Rohan from  urlLink Times School of Marketing .
344-He is going to  urlLink University of Michigan .
345-Best of Luck Rohan!!!
346-I've settled on buying the Hero Honda Karizma.
347-Costs about 85K (ouch...) my dad (and other poeple) suggests a car at that kind of outlay...
348-I have a community online that I've been trying to do somehting contsructive with @  urlLink http://tsm.indiatimes.com/community/  it'd appear that nothing seems to be working... it is deader than a fish out of water.
349-more time, more time...           
             Tux is the nickname for the mascot for Linux...
350-It was an interesting time on linux...          
             A person I thought was a good friend lied to me, on something that I feel is fairly trivial...   why did he do that is what has been troubling me the whole of this weekend...
351-I was mucking around with my hard drives partition and guess what... no operating system... it seems the the boot loader has been corrupted :(.
352-so I picked up  one of the free linux cd's lying around, installed it and downloaded a msn messenger version for linux and now I'm good to go... :D          
             Some months ago, when I was with BCCL, (the publisher of The Times of India and he Economic Times), I had a conversation with CTO of the group Internet company, Times Internet Limited.
353-Who asked me to put down some thoughts on how I see things on the internet shaping up.
354-While I did put down those thoughts, I never actually sent it to him, the file was lying around till I came across it a couple of days back.
355-Here is a rewrite of what I initially penned down (typed up?).
356-A lot of rambling about nothing in particular.
357-The positioning of a product or service is more and more targeted to more and more specific audiences?
358-Case in point are the BMW and Mercedes, both are from fine German engineering pedigree, both are premium luxury cars.
359-However the buyers of the two will probably as different as two people can be.
360-The former will be bought by a person who will drive the car himself and the latter probably by someone who has a chauffer (Yes, I know Mercedes also makes sports cars this is the general perception that I expressed here).
361-Such a huge differentiation in mindset is what branding is all about.
362-This trend is seen in media as well.
363-The rise of niche publications in developed economies such as the US and UK is illustrative of this.
364-Any media would broadly undergo the distinct phases of consolidation in the growth phase and then  fragmentation once the medium matures.
365-The internet is perhaps one medium which fragmented even before it matured.
366-This is perhaps explained by the global reach of the media and the fact that ideas can be easily replicated across geographical  political boundaries; i.e.
367-something that works in America, will almost certainly not work in India, simply because the maturity of the American market is of a different order of magnitude.
368-To illustrate this point further the existence and flourishing of sites like epinions.com (in the American context) and the apparent non-starter of the Indian equivalent mouthshut.com which are sources of information.
369-Or price comparison sites like mySimon.com which as far as I know has no comparable Indian site.
370-With this brief background, it would be instrumental to see the whole internet game in a different perspective .
371-The internet tends to promote the formation of groups of people with very specific interests.
372-A sort of mother of all niche publications, which you can talk back to and whats more it talks back to you and allows you to communicate with your peer group.
373-While the Bennet philosophy has been to be an aggregator of audiences by subsidizing the price the audience pays to retrieve content and then retrieving profit from the purchasing those audiences.
374-This can prove counter productive as far as the Internet goes, as the internet has people who are used to getting content for free and are likely to freeload.
375-On the other hand the audience which does pay to retrieve the content would then be most prized and wanted by an advertiser, if nothing to prove non frivolousness of their transaction with us.
376-The idea would be to convince the mass populace that information is of value.
377-The easiest way to ensure that is to look for focused verticals in the information segment.
378-The first one that comes to mind is economictimes.com or more accurately perhaps the work of ETIG.
379-The biggest problem that one can make out is how will people pay for it online.
380-Multimodal payment mechansims are already in use by the Indiatimes family of websites.
381-Virtual currency of some kind can perhaps be also created for this purpose.
382-What about the business we are in?
383-Content can take several forms, one of the forms could be that of blogs (such as the one you are reading right now).
384-Blogs are the latest rage in America, now spreading to other parts of the world.
385-Blogs are nothing but a personal running commentary on the world in general and sometimes specific to a topic.
386-Another form could be in the form of reviews.
387-Reviews can be on any topic, from the palces to party  eat out in Delhi to where to find the best shoes in Chandini Chowk.
388-Ineractivity which needs to be the cornerstone of such an offering.
389-Such content may well be in the form of a blog.
390-Traditional content in the form of newspapers, TV, Radio will definitely migrate in one form or the other to the web.
391-Evolution of devices like the Microsoft Tablet PC or the Handspring Treo are definitely a step in that direction.
392-In that respect standardisation under one name a la indiatimes.com is probably the biggest single mistake being undertaken by us and many others across the world.
393-This conclusion is based on our initial premise that internet promotes the formation of specific focus groups.
394-By definition these focus groups would be unlikey to turn to a general interest portal to get their kicks so to speak.
395-The creation of multiple brands would be a better branding and strategic idea, having a ghoomnahai.com rather than having something like Indiatimes Travel.
396-This gives an identity to the content and makes it more valued by its consumers.
397-The above, when seen in the overall context of evolution of media, is a perfectly logical sequence of events.
398-Growing media consolidates, and then fragments.
399-During the growth phase it is perfectly acceptable to have a single brand name, but the moment the medium matures (maybe in the context of the limited audience it gathers in the Indian scenario)   Show me the money!!!
400-Whether people will pay to read ( someday in the future see) such content is debatable.
401-The likes of Al Ries would have us believe that advertising will never work on the internet (which is something I disagree with strongly).
402-So what will happen?
403-Will the internet become a subversive medium which will undermine modern society as we know it.
404-A sort of a no mans land where no content will be paid for?
405-products and services being the only ones able to draw any sort of revenue?
406-The Truth as the immortal words form X Files go is out there...
407-My personal suspicion is that heavily prized content a la NYT or WSJ will not only be paid for, but will also attract significant advertising revenues.
408-For the rest, creation of strong niches will allow them to do the same   PS: Don't hesitate to comment...

             The Festival of Lights  This is one of the oldest Hindu festivals occuring in the month of Kartik, which commemorates the return of Rama to Ayodhya after an exile of 14 years.
511-It also marks the beginning of the new year and is celebrated with the lighting of lamps.
512-Diwali or Deepawali, literally 'an array of lamps', is the festival of lights and is celebrated on the darkest night of Kartik.
513-It is perhaps the most important festival in India.
514-Originally a Hindu festival, it has now crossed the bounds of religion and is celebrated by all in India with fervor and gaiety.
515-This day is a public holiday all over India.
516-Twinkling oil lamps or diyas light up every home and firework displays are common all across the country.
517-The goddess Lakshmi (consort of Vishnu), who is the symbol of wealth and prosperity, is also worshipped on this day.
518-This festive occasion also marks the beginning of the Hindu new year and Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, the symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom, is also worshipped in most Hindu homes on this day.
519-Another view is that Deepawali is meant to celebrate the destruction of the arrogant tyrant Bali at the hands of Vishnu when the latter appeared in his Vamana (dwarf) avatar.
520-The occasion of Deepawali sees the spring-cleaning and white-washing of houses; decorative designs or rangolis are painted on floors and walls.
521-New clothes are bought and family members and relatives gather together to offer prayers, distribute sweets and to light up their homes.
522-Diwali is also perhaps the oldest festival still celebrated today and is mentioned in the Ramayana.
523-The celebrations include the lighting of lamps and candles, and the bursting of crackers (fireworks).
524-Friends and neighbours exchange special sweets.
525-People buy new clothes and in fact, in certain communities, it is absolutely essential to wear new clothes on this day.
526-Diwali in India is equivalent to Christmas in the West.
527-Therefore it is also the time when people get the festival bonus to their salaries.
528-It marks the beginning of the new year for a large majority of Hindus, especially the trader community.
529-Preparations for the festival begin many days prior to Diwali.
530-It is time for a thorough cleaning of the house, for the belief is that Lakshmi will enter clean and nicely decorated houses.
531-The scientific reason is that the monsoon is a time for insects and fungus to breed.With the end of the monsoon, homes need to be cleaned and painted, and belongings aired and dried before the onset of winter.
532-The festival itself extends over about a week even though the most important day is the new moonday.
533-In east Bihar and northern India, two days before Diwali is celebrated as Dhanteras in honour of Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods.
534-He is believed to have emerged with a pot of amrita during the samudra manthan.
535-People bathe early in the morning and observe a fast, which is broken only after sunset with sweetmeats, puri and other delicacies.
536-On Dhanteras, new kitchen utensils are bought and kept at the place of worship.
537-The buying of utensils, according to one theory, relates to the myth of Dhanvantari emerging from the ocean with a pot in his hand.
538-Since he is also the physician of the gods, cleanliness and hygiene are essential to this festival.
539-The day before Diwali is celebratedas Choti Diwali or 'small Diwali'.
540-It is Diwali on a smaller scale, with fewer lights lit and fewer crackers burst.
541-The morning after Choti Diwali, the women of the house make beautiful, coloured rangoli in the doorway and courtyard.
542-Tiny footprints made out of rice paste are a special feature of the rangolis made for Diwali.
543-They signify the footprints of Lakshmi, as she enters the house.
544-In Hindu homes, Diwali celebrations involve a ritual puja to Lakshmi and also to Rama in the evening.
545-Songs in honour of the gods are sung and arati is performed.
546-Oil or ghee diyas are also lit.
547-The gods are offered kheel, batashe and khilone and various sweetmeats.
548-After the puja, the diyas are placed in and around the house: in the doorway, near the Tulasi plant, the backyard, every room and the back and front gates.
549-After this, crackers are burst, and people meet friends and neighbours to exchange good wishes and sweets.
550-Since Diwali falls on the new moon night, lamps are lit to brighten this moonless night.
551-According to a myth, Lakshmi will not enter a dark house.
552-The lamps also welcome home the spirits of dead ancestors, who are believed to visit on this auspicious night.
553-In addition, the light frightens away any evil spirit that might be wandering about near the house on this night.
554-In Orissa, lamps are lit to light up the dark path that the spirits of ancestors take back to heaven.
555-In modern times, ghee diyas have been replaced by wax candles and coloured electric bulbs.
556-In many areas, there is a competition of sorts among neighbours as everyone tries to have the brightest lights.
557-The origin of Diwali can be traced back to ancient India, when it was probably an important harvesting season.
558-It was thus extremely important to the largely pastoral Vaishya community.
559-Their granaries were full, and the weather was good, at the end of the long monsoon and before the arduous winter.
560-It was therefore a good time to celebrate.
561-The Vaishya community began their new year with this happy occassion, after paying their debts and clearing their ledgers.
562-As the religion developed, various mythological stories and explanations were attributedto this festival to give it religious sanction.
563-However today, this historical explanation is all but lost among the many stories and folklore linked with the origin of the festival.
564-According to the most popular one, Diwali is celebrated in honour of Rama, his consort Sita and brother Lakshmana, returning to their kingdom Ayodhya after a 14-year exile.To celebrate this event, people at Ayodhya are believed to have lit up their houses with lamps.
565-The illuminations also symbolise the removal of spiritual darkness and the onset of happiness and prosperity.
566-According to another belief, it is on this day that Lakshmi emerged from the ocean during the samudra manthan .Lakshmi Puja commemorates her birth and therefore forms a major part of Diwali celebrations.
567-Being associated with the goddess of wealth and fortune, Diwali is specially important to the Vaishya   community.
568-Most tradesmen close their old ledgers and dealings and start afresh with new ledgers after Diwali.
569-This day, with its emphasis on money, is also considered lucky for gambling.
570-Giving social sanction to a vice, a popular saying states that one who does not gamble on this day will beborn a donkey in his next birth.
571-Casinos and local gambling houses do brisk business during the Diwali week.
572-In most homes, people invite their friends and relatives over to play cards.
573-Another reason for the celebration of Diwali is that it marks the killing of the evil Narkasura at the hands of Krishna Naraka is believed to have abducted 16,000 women.
574-Krishna killed him and rescued these women whom he later married.
575-Naraka is the personification of hell and is believed to be the monsoon during which all activities come to a standstill.
576-Though Diwali is equally important in the south and the north, the celebrations are markedly different.
577-In South India, the story widely associated with Diwali is that of Narasimha, the man-lion incarnation of Vishnu.
578-According to a legend, Hiranyakshipu was an evil demon king.
579-He was unjust and cruel to his people.
580-However, he was almost invincible, having extracted a boon from Brahma that he would be killed neither by beast nor man, neither inside nor outside, neither during the day nor at night.
581-When his atrocities became unbearable, the gods sought Vishnu's help.
582-Assuming his fifth incarnation of Narasimha, the man-lion,Vishnu killed Hiranyakshipu with his claws in the courtyard just before day break, hence steering clear of the boundaries of the boon.
583-For this reason in the south, people light diyas in their houses on the day preceding Diwali.
584-The next day begins early.
585-First is the ritual bath, which begins with an oil massage of the hair and body.
586-This is absolutely essential on this day.
587-Its importance probably refers to cleaning oneself thoroughly after the monsoon months.
588-After bathing, people receive new clothes and gifts from their elders, which they are expected to wear.
589-The family then prays to Vishnu for its well-being and prosperity.
590-After the prayers start the main celebrations which, as in the north, consist of bursting crackers and lighting candles.At day break, all celebrations end.People then visit friends and relatives and exchange sweets.
591-References to the word 'atishbaji' or'crackers' are found even in ancient literature.
592-The bursting of crackers is today the most important and eagerly-awaited part of the Diwali celebrations.
593-According to one belief, the sound that resounds throughout the universe makes all aware of the great homecoming of Rama.
594-Another belief is that the crackers are an indication ofthe joy of the people living on the earth, making the gods aware of their plentiful state.
595-Still another possible reason has a more scientific basis: the fumes produced by the crackers kill a lot of insects, found in plenty after the rains.
596-The use of high-tech bomb crackers is fairly recent.
597-At times, Diwali celebrations get ugly, especially in the metropolitan cities.
598-In New Delhi, people start bursting crackers in the evening and this continues till the early hours ofthe morning.
599-As a result, the city is engulfed in toxic fumes and smoke for almost 10 hours.
600-Another problem with crackers is that their manufacture is usually unregulated.
601-As a result, the manufacturing units are unsafe and the material used is inflammable and toxic.Every year, many units are destroyed inaccidental fires, resulting in the death of those employed there.

             As a member of the Nokia planning team, I was party to the market Insight, that the device is becoming secondary to the whole process of communication...
665-While this is worrying to Nokia Nokia is itself digging it's own grave...  How?
666-For years, Nokia phones were known for their simplicity and ease of use, and admittedly by the top execs of hte company that the proprietary interface on their hones had a lot to do with it... Howver the newer Nokias are using the Symbian Series 60 based OS.
667-Which means that the interface is no longer the key distinguishing factor between the different brands of phones.
668-This coupled with the earlier insight would mean an ever weaking technological position which has been Nokia's marketing pitch in the past.
669-The oft repeated statement in any marketing course as to Technology no longer being a differentiator, but a leveller, will be true for Nokia.
670-This  Wired  story on cracking of the Nokia N-Gage Games to be run on other Series 60 OS phones (Siemens), illustrates the point above..

756-While cMarket has solved its immediate challenge, the implications of Jon's approach are potentially mind-bending.
757-What if other companies begin taking the same approach -- offering Indian-style wages to American workers?
758-On the positive side, we could begin to solve our job-creation problems.
759-But on the negative side, America's standard of living would inevitably decline.
760-There's only one way to find out for sure how it all might shake out, and that is for other executives to replicate Jon's experiment.
761-The results could be quite interesting.
762-What is irritating about this is that America waves the flag of globalisation and when globalisation hits it, it goes screaming like a baby...
763-This is similar to the Visa regimes instituted by the West post World War II, trying to stop the influx of immigrants to maintain a better standard of living.
764-When people world over figured that manufacturring in poorer countries is cheaper and businesses started moving manufacturing... America started screaming like a baby again about labor standards et al.
765-Conclusion of this Rant: If you want globalisation, allow free flo of labour.
766-oops, you can't do that... otherwise Indians will take over your tech jobs... :D       urlLink Link

772-The rumours of Cocaine content, and the subsequent removal fo Cocaine from the formula.

             In an Economist feature  urlLink The World In 2004  A story on the Smart Dust revolution.
784-Alun Andersen, the Editor in Chief comments that for decades we have considered progress to be packing of more and more transistors on less and less silicon... Progress he argues is, things like the coming smart dust revolution.
785-Smart dust or more accurately networked intelligenece to do  hazaar  things like do remote surveliiance for the military.
786-or the use of RFID in supermarkets... enabling tracking of merchandise and a  fully automated staff less  supermakret...    For almost 40 years we have all been subscribing to a simple dogma about the growth of the information age: progress means making more and more computing power available at lower and lower prices.
787-Back in 1965 Gordon Moore laid out his famous law that the number of components that could be squeezed on to a silicon chip would double every year or two.
788-Now everybody can buy a laptop computer with the computing power that entire nations were aspiring to in the 1970s.
789-Moores law still has a long future.
790-But in 2004 the belief that progress means packing in ever more computing power will be seen as far too narrow.
791-Just arriving is another kind of information revolution, driven by the ability to manufacture billions of tiny, intelligent communicating sensors.
792-Capable of organising themselves into networks, intelligent sensors will make up for their small brains by their immense numbers.

824-maybe in 48 hours as claimed by the  urlLink faq           
             The reason I commented on the lack of ads on Blogspot, was because Google denied an adsense account, reason given was that this URL was duplicate submisssion.
825-Considering that I only created the url a few days back, it is somewhat absurd...          
             As you can see, when you look at the top of  urlLink Marlinspike - Knot Untangler  There are no ads on this blogspot page.

866-The first time i heard the term Blogging, the first thing that came to mind was two men in Kerela on a Gogonet tree and one saying to the other, You are blogging my view.
867-However, now this means something totally different to me.
868-Blogging my view, now means that after reading your blog, my views are changing.
869-How many of us are actually willing to let go of our opinions and accept new ones as we just read or heard something different from the views we so strongly believed in all this while.
870-This is like writing a personal diary for everyone to read.
871-I always thought about those who write a diary.
872-I thought those were the people so desperate that someone  picks up their diary and reads it and saves them.
873-It was a cry for help for those poor recluses and introverts.
874-And then they made this rule, thou shall not read a personal diary.
